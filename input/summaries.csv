concerned, GComm is our internal package name...

quality GNUe web shopping cart ;-). Instead, he was looking to 
customize Interchange to provide a web shopping cart using PHP. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said that, although GNUe Inventory was not yet completed, you should be 
able to access another inventory package via GNUe Applications Server. 
However, the web interface for GNUe Forms was still in the works, as 
Michael Maluck (madlocke) had been quite ill.","2001-10-24","1"

"5","4","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) was seeing a GREAT 
value in DCL as a communication tool to customers,  
and as a billing tool and todo tool. But the communication tool would break 
when accounts had different products. It would be fairly easy to implement 
who-can-view-what by product, but then the next step would become billing (or 
services), at which point products and services would need to be 'separate'. This 
hadn't mattered before DCL was seen as a communications tool. Michael Dean (mdean) 
thought this use of services sounds like it could be an 
action. He planned to be work on it (minus 
billing) for work, so it will come.","2001-10-25","1"

manager to do assignments for GNUe; and Jason Cater had a fully functional 
40 node call centre. The call centre was not using Bayonne, although they would 
like to. Derek reckoned GNUe was about the best GPL-licensed system he had seen for 
RAPID development of cross platform applications. There were about 5 active 
developers, 10 more regular contributors, 30 people with assignments and several 
hundred on the mailing lists. There was no date for GNUe Accounting, but work was 
starting on it now.","2001-10-26","1"

triggers itself. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said it 
could really do either. They were also looking to support 
load balancing and replication in GEAS. But if your database supported it, 
you could have load balancing occuring behind GEAS. But several people 
thought that load balancing with GEAS could be complicated.","2001-10-26","1"

flexibility.","2001-10-27","1"

Two days later,, Jeff Bailey (jbailey) noted that GEAS 
doesn't seem to compile under windows because of the 
orbit dependancy. He asked if there was a timeframe for fixing that. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said no. Jeff said this meant he couldn't make 
GEAS part of the win32 package. Daniel said that 
GEAS only runs on GNU/Linux and *BSD -

porting GEAS to windows is not a priority

"21","12","2","Later on, Reinhard suggested using gprof, which 
 gives you statistics about time spent 
in each function as well as number of calls for each function sorted 
by the worst functions first (those eating most time) and lots of 
other stuff. Plus you can break it down to lines of code instead of 
functions. The only thing is it only measures cpu time 
not the time the process waits for disk access or network traffic. 
By contrast, Andrew's profiling 
code measures the RealWorld(tm) time spent in a function [...] which 
is a very inaccurate thing in a multi process 
operating system. However, Reinhard would not 
remove the profiling stuff without Neil's feedback.","2001-10-29","1"

it was very logical. Jason said currently, most of our 
tools don't use GDataSource directly, but subclass it... all of the subclassed 
GDataSources automatically handle this during init - but if it always happens, 
then it should happen at the most basic level :).","2001-10-30","2"

working on his user interface for GNUe Application Server (GEAS). 
Andrew said he had re-written bits of GEAS as 
it was doing bizarre things to my records. James said 
that GEAS had had a major overhaul, with more work planned. Andrew
said there was very little GEAS code left in his re-write. 
It was 2-tier with an Object Orientated wrapper but could easily 
be made 3-tier. It's about 4000 times faster 
than geas and it doesn't shag my data James said the major 
issue with GEAS was the use of temporary tables while building query 
structures, which seemed like major overkill.","2001-11-01","2"

slid in as a straight replacement for GEAS. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly)

not an app server. Andrew admitted his code was effectively a 
fat client, but I don't mind have a 3mb libary 
on every client. Vsevolod Lobko (sevik) asked 
what about thin clients and forcing business 
rules in server? Loading methods in the client would force all 
client applications to be in the same language. The 
website implied that Andrew's code 
only worked on plain one table selects or updates, and supported postgresql 
only.","2001-11-01","2"

the whole caching design is lame as hell -

GNUe Forms, GNUe Common and GNUe Designer to version 0.1.0. 
The patches to GNUe Common for the GNUe Application Server

format for ODBC - I'm going to make the 
provider='odbc' and take all the special meaning out of it. 
There was a general discussion about what jobs on GNUe needed 
doing next. Jason noted that GNUe Forms is now crashing on duplicate primary 
keys. Also, if you have an update and an insert, if the insert fails it 
will also rollback the update. James said this would be fixed in later

opportunity for someone like me to help out? Reinhard Müller

Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted that the GNUe Kernel Cousin was now linked 
from linuxtoday.com. Perry asked 
can you get gnuebot to put the occasional <a

the KC page to go direct to the start of the conversation? Later, 
Andrew noted that 1358 people had already read KC on linuxtoday. This had 
driven traffic to the www.gnuenterprise.org website, which was 
peaking at 15000 today. Derek Neighbors

"42","25","1","James Thompson (jamest) said he would like someone to write a 
GTK-specific driver for GNUe Forms - he intended to write a QT-specific one 
himself, and I'd rather have a windows app look 
like a windows app on windows machines. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
agreed, and even said 
we might want a native 
windows forms client. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) thought that was 
a bit too much code duplication.
Reinhard replied that there shouldn't be too 
much intelligence in forms for n-tier. But Jason Cater (jcater) 
pointed out that GNUe Forms would always be 2-tier as well as n-tier. 
Reinhard agreed, but said that the n-tier version could be different from 
the 2-tier version. The fact that James had previously described GNUe Forms 
as a ""reference implementation"" of a forms client implied there 
would be other clients as well in the future.","2001-11-05","2"

because I never see it running on things like Palm 
pilots. Whilst he was not against people creating specific clients 
for Windows 32-bit platforms written in the language

pretty well. (As a side issue, Jason Cater (jcater) noted that 
wx and python run on PalmPilots, prompting 
James to ask for one for ""testing""

He was keen for James to do a QT driver, 
but actually would rather see you look at making wxQT instead of just adding 
native qt support to forms. James said that was a major project -

pleasures from running the same form on their win boxen, web site, 
vt320 terminals Derek agreed, but said 
The simple fact is we need applications. 
One usable good solid app will do more than any number of ui options 
will. I'm half tempted to say one of the main focuses should be get 
one or more apps out. We all have some 'internal' stuff but I mean 
something useful and distributable.","2001-11-05","2"

that the forms specific language needed standardising. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) pointed out that the idea 
was to have a plugin system for various langauges. Jason said 
that adding more languagues might not be a priority. Daniel agreed,

more generalized so it could do report definitions as well.

names and basic schemas. Jason said that at the time GNUe had 
introspection support for postgres (and 
maybe Oracle).","2001-11-05","2"

the forms client can be open as many times as you like,

it does support multiple ""pages"" if 
your data doesn't fit on one screen but even then, only one page can be 
visible at once. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that 
historically curses based systems did this 
all via menus and I think most gui apps continued this tradition 
This way, the top level menus were 'modules' 
so to speak and the detail menus were 'processes'. Of course this is how 
'security was enforced' as well - either you had access to a menu option 
or you didn't. Not that he was suggesting a curses-style 
interface, just a similar 'effect' - 
tabs or something else.","2001-11-05","2"
"52","28","2","Jason also pointed out that we are trying to 
be UI independent. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said this was 
done by using XML, which could be displayed on anything. James said that 
the same form definition could be used on Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, and 
web users and possibly palm-pilot :)
You could also use old amber-screen text-only screens. A single user might 
have wanted to use full GUI, text-only telnet access or web-based depending 
on where they were and what they were doing. Also, users could work off-line
with a snapshot of the data.","2001-11-05","2"

medium businesses, but eventually I think we'll

they are tied into proprietary systems... 
we work with MANY, MANY systems. James said the aim was to 
Stop letting overpriced consultants sell you 
overpriced solutions that require overpriced customizations. We're all for 
consultants as some of us do that for a living but we're trying to keep them 
honest. If you don't like your current gnue consultant you can find another one.

a new BMW. Although this could be seen as quite a heavy 
thing to put on the user,  Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
this is true for all Free Software. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) gave the example of Nautilus, where the company went 
out of business, but the product lives on w/o the

if you don't like your consultant (s)he doesn't own the code, or the regional 
rights to the code. Anyone code savy can tweak the system.","2001-11-05","2"
"56","29","3","Derek said there would be nothing to stop a company hiring a GNUe consultant
and have them create a system for their business, but they could also
just use the base system or just devlop it 
internally. We plan to offer packages/modules that are like 'shrink wrap' so 
someone can walk up and use out of the box. In our experience we find FEW companies 
work this way. They have 'little quirks' on how they want things or they want it 
integrated elsewhere etc. That is where the 'consultant' role comes in. 
James expanded Eventually we'll have a clearing house 
of packages so you can just grab something close someone else has made and tweak it 
to your liking.","2001-11-05","2"

as possible yet be able to be used independently. For example, you would 
just usesupply chain, if you were already happy with your non-GNUe accounting

processes. Jason emphasised that we are really 
two projects in one: 1) A complete architecture for implementing 
business apps and 2) a set of packages that implement business apps.
Someone could do an educational management system using our 
architecture (rather easily, as a matter of fact), but this may 
not be a ""business process"" so to speak.","2001-11-05","2"

persuaded a large private company to GPL 
its HR/Payroll system and who was interested in working with GNUe. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said to forward him to info@gnue.org, but 
warned there were often problems in such cases with incompatible 
architectures or use of non-free componants. Peter said we could use 
GNUe Integrator if architecture was an issue. In response to queries, 
Derek explained that Integrator is a GNUe 
Tool that will allow you to merge disparate data. Work has yet 
to start on it, but it would build an XML definition of the two sources 
and visually match one field to another, applying rules. It would be run 
in either batch mode or real time.","2001-11-07","2"

Derek Neighbors said I think nautilus is a shining 
example of how in free software world a good product lives even if its company dies
. He continued obviously one could use GNUe for 
an ASP, but its not something we intend to encourage much. Peter said he 
didn't think GNUe early adopters were likely to be ASP clients anyway. 
Derek said the problem with ASP is you lose control of your upgrade process. ASP
was attractive to vendors because its easier to 'control' 
the customer. Peter said that was why free as in 
speech is more important than free as in beer for GNUe. Derek said that 
ASP was more risky, because ASPs were more likely to be the target of crackers, 
even if their security is better theoritically.","2001-11-07","2"

to compile a comprehensive list of report objects which woudl translate to

terminology. Derek said he had used Quickreports, but would welcome input from 
people who had used packages like Crystal Reports as well, to 
see what's missing, what's stupid. At this 
stage, this was reference material, not a proposal. Later, he admitted 
the part I'm torn on is we have two phases - 
pre data population, post data population - some of these are needed pre 
and some post and some both. It was not clear whether items like 
page numbers and orientation should be part of the XML, as they were 
display-dependant.","2001-11-08","3"

Neighbors (dneighbo) on another channel. He had asked if 
GNUe is to be language independent, how will you implement triggers? 
Derek said that there had been a lot of discussion about this. He remembered 
the thing we all agreed on was that we want to make 
a trigger/event system that is shared by the appserver and forms. 
Michael suggested XML. Derek said this had been discussed, but 
 it just didnt sit right in fleshing it out

"67","36","2","Later, Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said his proposed plugin system would 
remove this issue. Jason Cater (jcater) said this was different - 
we have to have a common way inside those languages to 
identify our objects. Daniel suggested GObject 
bindings ;). Jason later remarked however 
we maintain our object references, we have to answer the question
of how will the objects be represented in the language's namespace and how 
will those references tie back into the forms, geas, or reports 
instance? He liked the look of GObjects, however. Perry Lorier (Isomer) 
suggested for a v1.0 release, python only bindings

for v2.0 and rev quickly :)","2001-11-08","3"

GDataObject if you really think about it.","2001-11-08","3"

Two days later, Derek (derek) suggested supporting spidermonkey. 
Michael supported this, since it would make GNUe 
web forms triggers almost no-brainer. Derek clarified 
the idea was to make it so each development house 
wouldnt have to learn a 'new language' but could use their personal 
preference - our base packages will be python 
triggers but we want to let any language be used. If someone had an 
exisiting system in, say, perl, it might be easier to 
reuse a good portion of my code in gnue as well as not have curve of learning 
python. Jason pointed out that if someone 
is simply wanting to extend our packages, they wouldn't have to rewrite the base 
in their language - they could mix and match.","2001-11-08","3"

Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said we are doing xml 
from database in the reports module. They had 
looked at the xml query language from the gnome-db

Windows ODBC drivers had been tested, but a long time ago. Dmitry was 
also having problems with using GNUe Forms with postgres on Windows.

alternative installation scheme would be to have two installation 
.exes, one with just the client software and another one for full 
development. James said the environment variables should logically go in 
the Windows Registry, but no-one was very keen on this, because as James
himself pointed out as it sets we

to work some kinks out of the system. He later said

Reinhard suggested a 
rather static page for an overview of the project.

a dynamic front page had been to make 
it easier to let OTHERS maintain, as getting volunteers

"92","47","1","Michael Brown (mcb30) asked 
what's the differnce between running with and without GEAS?
Reinhard Müller said the 
most important difference is - running without geas works - 
- running with geas doesn't. He explained that 
business objects are like ""
intelligent"" database tables - not only data but also methods.
In a working GEAS set-up, GNUe Forms/Reports would 
access the business objects instead of 
the db. The main problem 
with GEAS as of the time of writing was speed.","2001-11-16","4"
"93","47","2","Later, Neil Tiffin (neilt) confirmed that GEAS only 
worked with either C methods or Python methods, but not both. To do this, 
it would need code to catalogue both the C and Python methods, determine 
which style of methods to use and handle 
duplicated names. Michael asked With 
the python methods, is it permitted to modify the python code while 
GEAS is running or not? Neil said it loads 
all methods into python at startup, so changes would have no effect.
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) explained some of the initial thinking behind this, 
and said it might be better if you place the new 
code out there and its not loaded until you specifically tell it to. 
This could even be linked to a cron job for periodic updates. Later on, he 
confirmed that he did not favour automatically loading new methods, as 
some transactions could be mid 
'flow' at the time the code changed.","2001-11-16","4"
"94","47","3","Later, Michael reported I seem to have found 
a problem with the python method dispatch. Reinhard confimed 
every module should have its own 
namespace and said this is scary -
you seem to understand that code better after 6 hours as i do after 6 
months :) He said that the parser library 
is being rewritten at the very moment, 
and invited Michael to submit any wishes 
for it. He also asked for input on coding style issues.","2001-11-16","4"

The next day, Michael outlined the changes he had made to the GEAS 
code to allow it to support both Python and C methods at the same time. 
He asked is it acceptable to have no method handling 
support built in to GEAS? Daniel though this should be an error condition - 
what good would the server be with 0 methods? 
The consenus was that the default would be to compile all types of methods. 
Later, Daniel said he would like to be able to mix and match methods 
but at the object level - GEAS would 
search for something that could implement the language, load it into cache 
if necessary and then load the method. He feared this 
might be kinda slow though.","2001-11-16","4"

Three days later, Michael asked Is 
it reasonable to assume that all methods for a particular 
class that are of a particular type (e.g. glibmodule) will be 
implemented within the same file? Reinhard Müller said 
not at all imho - they might 
even be from different applications. Michael said he was 
thinking about dynamic loading and how to 
determine which methods need to be reloaded when I notice a file has 
been modified - he could scan all methods, or keep a cache.
Reinhard said can't you query what methods 
are contained in a file? Michael said this wouldn't cope with
methods being removed. He described how a cache would work. Reinhard 
suggested glib's GList implementation 
for the cache lists - he was not keen on GHash. Michael was 
worried about speed and scalability for long lists - Reinhard thought 
the time needed to reload a single code 
file from the disk would be more significant, but left it up 
to Michael.","2001-11-16","4"

Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked about using GObject. This would create a

and potentially multi-threading. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked about 
portability, and said lately i see such a ton of 
projects being killed by their dependencies. Daniel pointed out that 
GNUe was already dependant on an earlier version of glib. He would check 
exactly what systems it will compile on and 
work. Whilst end users wouldn't notice much difference, it would help 
developers - I am not doing my own OO glue crap 
in C and yes I like programming with objects.","2001-11-16","4"

Derek said so 
now you do a db create script in xml and run a python program

very, very enthusiastic about this. Derek said they already had style sheets 
for many databases - and creating a new one is as 
simple as copying exisitng style sheet. James asked 
why not make a sql92 compliant one? 
Both Derek and Michael pointed out that there was no such thing as a fully 
compliant database, but Derek said I 
see your point, might make one that is sql92 compliant 
so in theory a bit of minor hacking might make it usable on your db.","2001-11-19","4"
"107","52","1","Following a discussion about getting GNUe into RedHat distributions, 
James Thompson said I think we should wait for 
0.3.0 (ui rewrite) for that personally as it'd have more wow factor.
Jason explained that the User Interface rewrite would allow GNUe to
address the shortcommings in the current UI.
James said he wanted to add dynamic positioning, 
menus, etc, etc [...] add curses, web, wxPython, gtk, qt ui drivers

Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said software

the two auxillary things i want to 
see started are - workflow, document managment. These 
would link to virtually every other part of GNUe. 
For workflow notifications, 
you could 'bolt' those into the form via triggers
but it wouldnt be the 'long' term solution.
Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked What 
sort of work should I do on the docustore if I pursue 
it? Derek said the key issue was ensuring any work done 
was completely GPL. Nick said 
I can work from the work I've done as long 
as the implimentation is independent. In terms of the 
specification, Derek said it should 
be tightly integrated into geas/forms/reports
(which should be a given IF its using common properly).
Nick said he didn't want to tie the design a particular 
language - Its an interface spec so the 
language of the modules is irrelement. Derek agreed, and said 
that if the server used GNUe Common, people could

though, is authentication and security. 
Derek said that document management could be useful 
even OUTSIDE security. Security needed to 
be a shared issue for the whole of GNUe - security 
and workflow are like the two things most everything will need to use. 
However, right now there is ZERO ZIP 
NIL document management stuff (that i have seen) for linux or free software in 
general. So this would be a HUGE win
even if basic or no security and basic or no workflow attached to it.
Even a basic yes you can log 
in or no you cant level of security would be a start, and this could 
then be developed further.","2001-11-20","4"

done some thinking about methods, geas and code-sharing

http://www.fensystems.co.uk/geas-ideas.tex. Later, Derek 
Neighbors (dneighbo) said the document was good - 
as we need specs for geas and how 
it will work with forms :) He added 
with some polish i think this document 
could be useful as 'the managers introduction to gnue'.","2001-11-21","4"
"115","57","2","Later, Reinhard Müller said current 
state we see geas not providing lookup fields directly
and described his preferred way of acheiving the same effect. 
This meant that the object reference fields would be 
read-write. Michael asked 
 how do you use that through a non-OO 
interface? Reinhard said we 
can of course have 2 different interfaces - 
one providing a relational view and the other the oo view - 
but for the relational view i'm not sure for what we need geas anyway - 
and why not accessing the db directly for that. 
Michael asked whether the data interface in GNUe Forms treated  
the data as object-oriented or relational, and said 
I was thinking of the code that provides the 
data interface being part of gnue-common rather than just GEAS.
Reading further in the document, Reinhard said 
i definitively like the idea of a single method language that 
is translated into whatever the method executer understands

two complete different worlds once - and the distance between them seems to 
fade away. He was worried that if 2-tier became too similar to n-tier 
it would lose its simplicity ; if n-tier became too similar to 2-tier it would 
lose its power and scalability. 
Michael said I don't think that should happen, 
but it would be good to share code where possible. Reinhard said 
he felt at an emotional level that 
geas is in the process of loosing importance continously.
James Thompson (jamest) said not 
at all - geas is the cornerstone of the n-tier gnue - we just want to 
gut it lots of it to put in a common lib. He had had similar issues 
with GNUe Forms/Designer, but I took secret 
pleasure in watching gnuef distro size shrink [...] 
while some people boast 750,000 lines of code here I am hoping to make 
our code base smaller. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
I've always heard that a sign that a product 
is maturing is that it's code base starts shrinking instead of growing - 
of course, there's no way forms is mature :) Reinhard 
mentioned the old Chinese proverb - something 
is perfect not when there's nothing more to add
but when there's nothing more to take away.","2001-11-21","4"

should go into GNUe-Common, then 
geas almost becomes a python application. He clarified 
that although a method in n-tier was similar to a stored database 
procedure in 2-tier, this wasn't how it should be implemented - 
this defeats MANY of the goals of geas.
He continued the 
MORE i think about things i think we shoudl be using xml
for GNUe class definitions, as it would make them human readable and
easy to convert to other formats - its 
as easy as writing a stylesheet. He pointed out that

intention was to move this into GNUe-Common as well.","2001-11-21","4"

not xml [...] xml will be the interface between 2 systems but not between a 
system and a user. Derek explained that the XML would be 
the single source code that gets turned into 
db triggers/stored procs. This meant you 
end up with a nice clean .xsl file for each db implementation
and it serves better as an INDEPENDENT tool - 
part of the goal of GNUe is all tools work together or separately
XML of itself would probably not create any extra dependancies, as it
was needed for other parts of GNUe, notably Reporter.","2001-11-21","4"

Several images on the gnuenterprise.org website seems to be made with 
non-free Adobe software.
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said we 
accept contributions without regarding what tools were used to do the work. 
This was especially true of documentation, which was always in
short supply for GNU projects. The key issue was that the 
format itself isn't proprietary, and it can be viewed without proprietary programs 
He added if you want to redo those pictures 
in dia (or whatever) we will gladly take it. 
Cyril agreed that the graphic itself was a PNG, and hence viewable by 
free software. But You can consider this PNG as a 
binary distrubution of the contrib, not the source code. We NEED to be able to modify 
the code. Reinhard said he would prefer that the diagram was maintained in a 
free tool, and emphasised that using Adobe was a temporary solution. 
Neil Tiffin (neilt) said any program that reads png which 
is a standard format can edit the graphics - as far as he was aware, 
png is a vector format graphic, so all vector information 
is in the version on the web. Reinhard said that 
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ implied 
PNG was a pixel-based format like GIF or JPEG. Although the graphic could theoretically 
be edited in a pixel-based graphic editor, this would be inconvenient. 
Cyril said friends 
of mine are using dia and xfig for this kind of graphics.
Neither Neil or Reinhard were keen on dia, but Neil installed xfig to see how 
it worked. He added I 
would use dia, as soon as someone provides a way to convert dia diagrams 
into our gcd format. It could then be used as a graphical front-end 
for designing .gcd files.","2001-11-25","5"

we had discussed possibly doing this 
completely open. Bradley Kuhn (bkuhn) said 
I'd like to do it in an open way, as long 
as the traffic doesn't become unbearable. It didn't really 
matter whether the discussion was on #gnuproject or #gnuenterprise, 
although #gnuenterprise had a more reliable logging mechanism.
Derek said It would be nice for the GNU 
project as a whole to have a meeting like this minimally once a month
- just to get the maintainers in same room and see where paths collide
- and projects that are working together to show the fruit 
Bradley said That's probably impossible, but
I do think the GNU project as a whole should have an 
annual meeting. They discussed what the meeting scheduled for 
later on would cover, and considered postponing it.
Bradley said so, really, this is a ""
DotGNU and GNU Enterprise"" meeting, since they are going to 
merge.. Derek said that is what he wanted to discuss, as 
I dont see how groupware and dotGNU can 
merge into a 'project' - I see how phpGroupWare could adopt 'dotGNU' 
for part of it - but really dotGNU is protocols not an application.
He continued In essence I don't believe groupware 
standards belong in the dotGNU spec. Bradley thought 
phpGroupware fits well as a part of DotGNU because 
one of the key things the DotGNU folks are trying to do is services of all 
different types. DotGNU is probably going to be a big tent, in the same way GNU 
Enterprise is. Derek said if they say 
groupware is one of the first apps they wish to write using dotGNU 
then i think that makes sense :). Derek explained the distinction 
between GNUe Tools and GNUe Applications. Bradley said the DotGNU project 
had the same sort of concept, although the project 
is young enough that they don't have clear names for the parts yet.","2001-11-26","5"

but in a way that users / customers can be sure that they can't get locked 
in. DotGNU didn't necessarily have to match everything in Microsoft .NET 
one-on-one, But we must provide all of those building 
blocks. David Sugar (dyfet) clarified that the intention was to be

exist [...] but not where it either compromises commercial integrety or security.

"141","67","6","Bradley said he thought 2. and 1. were the most important and 
3, 4, 5 might fall out in the wash when we come to consensus on 2,1. He 
said the groupware standards need to define what ways RPC 
is going to happen. Derek disagreed - the 
group ware standard should have ZERO to do with implementation. 
Groupware specifications should be architecture independant. Bradley said
he agreed - It should be possible to write to the 
groupware specs without a specific RPC implementaiton in mind.
But, I think amoung the groups in question, it would be good to have a ""decided upon"" 
default way of doing.","2001-11-26","5"
"142","67","7","Jason Cater (jcater) explained how the GNUe Common package 
was intended to be an abstraction layer for various RPC methods
- be it CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, etc He continued 
Our goal is to write a lightweight wrapper around all of these
that will allow us to add new methods as time goes on David said 
this fitted in with what was going on in DotGNU 
and also it would be very useful in GNUCOMM right now...  Bradley said
one of the concerns that I would have is that this has been 
tried so many times and had major drawbacks.  I am thinking particularly of Bonobo, 
which is so hard to use. Derek said this was different - 
they have goal of trying to change industry - we have goal 
of trying to unify it Norbert suggested Jabber As Middleware (JAM) - 
a variation of the Jabber protocol which has stalled, and 
which the proponents are trying to revive by selling DotGNU on it :-)
Derek and Jason said the advantedge of an abstraction layer was that it was 
easier to adapt it as new/better transport mechanisms came along. Derek said
we have need for this regardless and are willing to write 
it (in fact we have started already) - we would love to share it and make it usable by 
all. James Thompson (jamest) clarified that it's 
python only at this time - Jason said the python version was 
really a proof of concept/reference implementation. 
Derek said it should be easy to convert the python module to C, if 
performance was an issue. Dan Kuykendall (Seek3r) pointed out All 
of this needs to be language independant anyways. Bradley agreed, saying 
the issue was that what gnuE is doing in this regard is simply 
not incompatible with what other projects are doing, since the other projects (DotGNU, 
phpGroupware) are planning to support XML-RPC, SOAP, or a protocal like that.
Derek and Norbert said both their projects wanted to support as many protocols 
as possible. It was felt GNUe Common should be renamed (possibly to GNU-RPC), to 
avoid confusion with the GNUComm project, as previously suggested in  

.","2001-11-26","5"
"143","67","8","It was asked how an abstraction layer could work if it didn't know what the 
methods were written in. Jason said the layer does not 
care about your methods -  it just needs to know what they are. Daniel 
asked how can you amke an abstarction layer that 
talk to stuff without knowing what methods to call. IDL could be used 
for that. Derek tried to clarify if the other projects were interested in a common 
library (i.e. shared code) or just common standards. Several people felt the 
discussion was fragmenting, and it was agreed to move to the #gnuproject channel 
and discuss this further.","2001-11-26","5"
"144","67","9","On 
#gnuproject, Bradley changed the topic to 
RPC Compatibility for Related GNU projects. Derek explained it would 
be like a database abstraction only for rpc. 
Dan thought this was ambitious, due to the need to support multiple languages. 
Derek, Michael and Jason agreed it was ambitious, but not impossible. The other 
projects would not have to use the common RPC broker, but could offer it as an 
option. Bradley proposed GNUe might as well give this 
idea a try. and, meanwhlie people can use XML-RPC. Dan said he still 
had concerns about supporting multiple languages, and the 
problem is that if we all work on using this common broker, then we will lose
sight of the standard procotols such as xml-rpc and soap. Bradley and 
Jason explained that the point of the common RPC broker was that programmers 
would not have to worry about which protocol was actually in use. Jason and 
Michael clarified that this was not a new protocol - just a way of abstracting 
multiple different existing protocols. Dan said they were doing a similar kind 
of abstraction, but for methods in PHP Groupware with the 
ExecMethod() function, so that the 
program didn't have to know what the method was actually written in. Derek emphasised 
we are only wanting to abstract initially the 
transport, not the methods themselves. Bradley said that, even if the attempt 
to write a common RPC broker failed, are we any worse off 
than we were if they hadn't tried? Jason reiterated GNUe's goal, which was to 
to seemlessly support as many as possible, not just XML-RPC and SOAP, 
which were fairly similar anyway.","2001-11-26","5"
"145","67","10","Bradley summarised. The GNUe project would continue their work on 
GNUe Common/GNU-RPC, which the other projects would be interested in if it 
proved feasible. In the meantime, XML-RPC was probably a better choice as a 
standard for a single protocol than SOAP.","2001-11-26","5"

ANY ORB you want - or XML-RPC - or SOAP or whatever. 
Yurii said his project, 
E/AS (Enterprise / Automation System), 
was looking to use omniORB. Derek asked why not just 
join gnue? There was already significant 
Russian involvement in GNUe, and

I WANT to publish E/AS source under GPL or

plenty of non-fanatic developers ;-) Yurii also said E/AS wanted 
to build the system using Python from the 
scratch, using C elsewhere where we need performance (or something else that 
requires C). Jason Cater (jcater) said that was similar to GNUe - 
except for GNUe Application Server (GEAS), we are a 
pure python implementation. Yurii added Our 
model is not an application server. We imagine the whole system is a 
dynamic distributed object database. Derek said that, if this involved 
relational data storage, then that was all 
that GEAS was anyway. Yurii explained that the object 'database' in E/AS 
can be stored anywhere - RDBMS, DBM, memory, 
plain disk partition. Derek said this was the same goal as GNUe - 
we just started with relational

language. Jason said, based on his experience, he thought they would find python was 
the most helpful w/dynamic objects. Yurii said
they had thought about security issues, but hadn't specified anything yet. 
He explained in detail how objects would work without class notation. 
He said I looked both at Pyro and PyDO. They 
aren't the system that I've described. Jason asked 
Where do business rules fit in?

pydo .. perhaps i could contribute this. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
said GNUe Designer needed this for 
the 'wizards' to work - also anyone wishing to use common outside of 
gnue forms would find useful - and even within forms people might want 
the ability in triggers... James Thompson (jamest) said 
I think postgresql drivers would be the one 
to learn from as that already had introspection. Derek said it was 
best to get the database connection code working first, 
then when that is working move to the 
introspection functions (not they arent important, but they are less 
critical).","2001-12-10","7"

works with sapdb .. now off to the introspection-thingies :)
He hadn't tested it with dates, however. James confirmed that the 
introspection did not include primary-foreign key relationships, although 
it could be extended to cover this. However, the 
designer designs UI not the table layout at this time. He 
explained schema discovery is a new feature of 
the dbdrivers and is not mature or complete - what we have now is setup 
your db - run a wizard in designer that looks at a single table and 
autobuilds a simple form - manipulate that form to get what you like - 
wizards can be written as plugins and I hope to see master/detail wizard 
someday - we can extend the dbdriver model to meet our needs if people 
find it lacking.","2001-12-10","7"

data types were supported in GNUe Common, reporting that he was 
half way of introspection-support for sapdb

postgresql driver converted database-specific data types to more generic 
types for GNUe Common. He said i 
think the 'data types' in GNUe Forms are pretty 'limited'
Ulrich asked why in the oracle driver ""
LONG RAW"" is mapped to ""number"" this is strange ...
Jason Cater confimed that Oracle treated LONG RAW as 
Raw binary data up to 2 gigabytes (cannot be a 
key) Ulrich asked is there a hook for 
converting longs to e.g. stringio ?? sapdb needs to handle long-fields 
with some <longfield>.read() method ... Jason said 
we haven't implemented blob-like support 
yet and suggested you might want to put a 
# TODO: comment in there saying that those types weren't implemented 
because you need buffer-like capabilities (or something to that 
effect).","2001-12-10","7"
"155","74","1","Ulrich Ech said he still 
need to figure out how to build complex forms/apps
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he usually started in GNUe 
Designer, and then would run 
a wizard against the 'biggest/base' table for my form
and let it auto create that. Then i use designer to add additional 
datasources (detail) and the widgets needd to support them.
Ulrich asked how to do master/detail forms. Derek said
just add a new datasource 
then in it fill out the information to bind to a master
[...] you have to pick the fields to 'link' on.","2001-12-11","7"
"156","74","2","Derek said that using GNUe would always be more limited 
in the sense you are a LOT less confined 
say writing an app in C and GTK+ - however it will take you a lot 
longer and you will be tied to 
single UI. It was a question of the right tool for the job. 
In his experience  thus far 'most' data 
aware business applications are a good choice for gnue
as fancy widgets etc arent all that necessary and the 
maintainability, speed to develop and UI choices are worth 
it.","2001-12-11","7"

see GNUe as being app ready...you can hack up a nice 2-tier app for 
now with it, but that's not what you want in the long run. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said there's 
nothing wrong with 2-tier - it's a different approach.

else in common was designed to be available to any python developer

(electronic business XML. So today companies already use erp systems.
the ebXML specifications provide a framework to get a global electronic 
marketplace. This allows companies to define 
their business processes in XML document and send this XML docuemnt 
to a registry. Businesses could use this registry to find trading 
partners with compatible business processes, and create a 
new XML document, called Collaboration 
Protocol Agreement.. The ebXML software at both parties would then 
use this CPA to define the 
roles (buyer, seller), the documents which have to be sent (order, 
shipment notice, bill etc) and in which order, using the data within 
each company's ERP system. This implies the need for a 
gnue-ebxml convertor.

SandSurfer has client billing included and some 
other company related features. Derek said it could either be 
incorporated into GNUe, or integrated by being 
flexible to someone adding stubs where necessary to interface to GNUe. 
GNUe normally used python rather than perl, but Jason Pattie said

this will be a process of growth - my boss wanted 
to incorporate payroll into SandSurfer, but wanted to check to make sure 
that there weren't systems out there already so we wouldn't reinvent the 
wheel yet another time. They were currently using 
a web-based accounting system which is open

any reason you didnt use 
sql-ledger/ [...] just curious as it seems popular and is perl

currently using it as an alternative to gnucash. He personally 
still cant imagine doing books via a web 
interface, but i suppose if you are low volume you could do so w/o tearing 
your hair out. Because of validation issues, the entry forms often 
had to have multiple pages. Redrawing the 
screen after every 'action' was also not suitable for high-volume 
usage. The GNUe HTML front-end would have similar issues, 
the difference is it become optional w/o 
recode so if i make a gnue form for something it can be used web, curses, 
gtk, win32 - so the folks doing 500 invoices can use gtk or such and not 
suffer penalty - but for a same disparate organization they can use the 
webforms.","2001-12-12","7"

dependency in moving to pyhton > 2.0. If you already had 
python 1.x, then when installing things 
invariably they go in wrong places :) - i solved this on red hat by 
just instalilng everything from source using the 
actual tarballs - though you SHOULDNT 
have to do that. There was some general discussion about the 
relative merits of Red Hat rpm and Debian apt-get. James said he had

Four days later, Phil Cole (fil_c) asked Could 
Python2 use Python-1.5 PyXML libs?
James Thompson (jamest) said you 
could copy the precompiled files but you'll get lots of 
warnings about differences in the API IIRC
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested 
i would grab pyxml tar from sourceforge, 
as Red Hat RPMs for python were not very stable at the 
time of writing, as python is in a state 
of moving from 1.5.2 to 2.x as official release within Red Hat - 
there had been similar issues with Debian the previous month. Phil went 
off to sourceforge. 
Derek said i 
REALLY apologize for the inconvience, i know it 'pisses me off' when 
stuff has dependencies or is a pain to install - we made the choice to 
go python 2.x because it brought us some much desired functionality and
we dont expect gnue to ship with any distros until 1.5.2 has been moved
and 2.x replaces in the distro's anyhow - 'unfortunately' it means a 
little rougher first time experience in the interim :(
He normally did the RedHat testing, but had actually upgraded 
python to 2.x by using source code. He felt often RedHat rpms 
tended to ask for unecessary upgrades - they 
'try' to understand 'dependencies' but what they 
really mean are what was on the 'authors' machine.
He said believe me the long term of GNUe 
is that no one has to fight like this to install things :)
- the windows installer is a good example of this
- i think my 3 year old might be able to handle the windows 
install. He said that the setup.py file 
bitches hey python 2.x isnt installed, 
but could be made more sophisticated and check other possible python problems.

keep the focus on making the basic business tasks (writing interfaces 
to get data into the system) very very easy and the other stuff may 
make you work a bit harder. Even as of writing,

python can do. Another benefit of keeping 
the UI simple - the same file worked seemlessly on text and

Some questions:  How about multiple languages?  
Each .gfd file is language specific. And how to cater for different

the next release of GNUe Forms intends to address 
several of these [...] we are going to try to better incorporate i18n into 
the next release but we are still up in arms about how to do it.
At the time of writing, you did need a seperate GNUe Forms Definition
(.gfd) for each language, although it might be possible to 
dynamically generate them from GNUe 
Application Server in the future. i18n support was an important issue for 
GNUe, as we have quite a few international users 
who keep reminding us of where we're lacking :) Phil said this sort 
of functionality could also be used for end user 
personalisation (e.g. (re)moving the fields on a form. Jason said 
this was definitely worth considering.","2001-12-17","8"
"186","88","2","Phil said you could split off the triggers - 
still leave the xml definition but the action occurs in a trigger file
. Jason said we can do that now with

multi-language problem.","2001-12-17","8"
"187","88","3","Phil suggested one way could be to move all 
""language"" to just be labels. Then the actual text for the 
labels be defined multiple times. This would also cope with 
different lengths of text even within the same language, e.g. 
'Purchase Order' and 'Pur. Ord.' 
Or you could have different .gfd files for each language, 
or both of the above. Jason said 
I'm not sure if that's the ideal long-term 
solution. Phil asked how to cater for 
different positioning of form objects due to differing language 
lengths. Jason said we currently only 
support absolute positioning and asked 
how would you do dynamic length labels in an absolute system?
Phil said I dont think that's possible.  
It would require a separate .gfd for each language. 
Jason said the main drawback to this 
method is that if a form is changed (rearranged) you have to modify every 
language file, instead of changing just one [...] or that the translator 
would also have to worry about positioning as well as translation.
Phil agreed, and suggested perhaps we could make 
the alternate language forms optional - treat english as a master and use 
it and it's position but with foriegn labels if a specific foriegn form 
doesn't exist.","2001-12-17","8"

interface we can graft that in to geas? Reinhard said 
my understanding is you have to write a 
c wrapper around the python lib. James said that was one way, 
but also the C api can manipulate the 
objects directly so you did not need a wrapper library.
He added my hope is that if I can graft 
this in we'll gain a few things - GConditional support, about 15 more 
interfaces geas can use :). He should be able to do start this 
over the next two weeks. Reinhard said 
we should agree on the interface as soon as you know it's doable -
before you start real implementation. ","2001-12-19","8"
"192","90","2","He asked whether the new dbdriver (shall 
we call it gedi?) systemwas intended to just support python, 
or C as well. James said most the db 
drivers in python i believe are written in C with a python interface
 anyway. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said you could 
do everything in C, but this was 
probably only worth it if speed was a concern. He didn't see 
dependancies as an issue - i see as we 
mature we will build stable snapshots of ALL dependencies and post on 
our site and bundle with our installer. This didn't rule out 
the possibility of a non-python driver, 
but it means really rewritting common in C.","2001-12-19","8"
"193","90","3","Reinhard asked what version of python the 
common dbdriver system would 
require. James said GNUe was standardising on python 2.x - 
the loss of 1.5.2 support was a deliberate 
move on our part. Reinhard said this meant that if he wanted 
to re-use the drivers on another project 
because i get 15 db's supported automagically this would create
a dependancy on python. But as soon as 
we have the c api we have at least the theoretical option to recode 
common in c and be compatible. James agreed, but said 
I don't see much need unless performance 
suffers, as even Windows could suport python now.
Reinhard asked where the api of the 
dbdriver system was documented. James said 
DataObjects.txt - well it's called 
GDataObjects in the code. Reinhard said he would read it and 
comment.","2001-12-19","8"
"194","91","1","Phil Cole (fil_c) said One of the major areas that causes 
issues in ERP vendors software seems to be reconciling invoices received 
against purchase receipts made. This was because 
there are partial receipts, partial invoices and differing 
financial periods. He explained In our system 
when a purchase receipt is made a financial posting is made an accural 
account... then when the invoice is recieved posted into a received invoices 
account. Stuart Quimby(ToyMan) said matching to the PO 
shoud be straight ahead if you use PO #'s. Phil added 
... then the invoices need to be matched to the purchase 
receipts... and the purchase receipt account matched against the registered 
invoices account...  .. this is where we have problems..
Stuart said this was one of the messier aspects of things, 
no matter what sf you use... but good software makes it better.
Phil said ... we should be able to reconcile recieved 
invoices account ledger account balance by looking through the logistical postings..
 .. and this hasn't been working for us. He explained 
we use a single supplier creditor account and a single 
recieved invoices account which shouldn't be an issue.
Stuart agreed - you'd only have to have more if you needed 
to break it out - for instance, to split office 
supplies from raw materials. Phil said we would 
probably do that via statistics codes on the items purchased
or by posting to different General Ledger account codes based 
on something in that purchase receipt (e.g. item code of 
purchased item).","2001-12-19","8"

- b. because there are not shrink wrap applications small and 
medium size businesses cant get the software they need to tailor 
to their unique processes, which he thought was self-
contradiction. He said that he saw GNUe as having 
vastly different audiences

very powerful, but not the most 'intuitive'

lookup dialogs for slightly more intuitive lookups on 'key fields'.
Stuart thought that 
the ability to click on a field in a 'grid' view and say 'gimme just those'

James wondered how you build up your 
queries into something (oql?) then parse that into sql
Reinhard explained 
oql is just the name of the source file that does this
. He said 
you tell me your favourite way to pass the conditions

if there is a std OQL then that may 
be the way to go. Reinhard said that there were three 
possibilities - OQL, SQL or 
some tree structure, but everything would need to be 
parsed into SQL eventually. James noted 
you can see the conversion process 
in dbdrivers/_dbsig. Although using OQL might maximise 
compatability with other Applications Servers, Reinhard felt 
this could be messy, in that GNUe Common would be converting 
a tree to OQL, then GNUe Application Server would convert the 
OQL back to a tree and then to SQL.","2001-12-18","9"

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) agreed, saying 
it might be that the 'customization' you desire we agree should be there 
in which case it would be more practical for all to integrate that 
functionality into forms. Ulrich said he needed 
trees (maybe lists) in an easy way [...]
i find that a complex account/network-management needs to give several 
possiblities to the user to find information.

trees and some of these other widgets is they are not 'portable'
 to user interfaces like curses. Ulrich said he did 
not really need html/curses interfaces for this

driver, but if you are having ideas you might wish to jot them down :)
 James explained I'm talking about a 
generic wrapper to python that geas would use to assess the python objects
- it makes the geas code cleaner. My thought was should I spend a little

2 DataObject instances and 2 
ResultSet instances. James Thompson (jamest) explained that 
the datasources use the connection 
manager to pool connections. Jason Cater (jcater) 
confirmed there's ALWAYS a 1:1 mapping 
between DataObject and DataSource, and James added 
a 1:1 mapping between a dataSource 
and a backend table(or object). In which case, Reinhard 
asked, why do we have two distinct 
classes for DataObject and DataSource? Jason explained 
that datasource is just a placeholder 
until a dataobject is loaded - dataobjects were specific 
for each database provider (postgresql, Oracle, etc.). James said 
the intention was that the app 
programmer never deals with a dataobject directly.
Reinhard said he had just been about to propose something like 
this!","2001-12-21","9"
"212","101","2","Reinhard also asked In which 
cases do we have more than one ResultSet for a single DataObject?

handy in editing - as my users wanted to edit all the details for 
multiple masters at once. Jason checked if

about data types?, that is, does 
it check values when fields are set? James said 
they are all stored as strings.
Jason confirmed typecasting is on the todo 
list. James said this meant that, at the moment, 
my form dies on a field that's tied to a 
date field in the db. The available datatypes were listed in
common/src/GTypecast.py 
but weren't complete. Reinhard pointed out that 
geas/src/classdef/classdef.h contains 
a list of geas datatypes and felt the GNUe Common datatypes 
should be the same. James said it would be simple to do this. Reinhard 
pointed out that this was important for  
introspection and schema creation, as 
the datatype will be a parameter to 
functions. James said that 
introspection is a work in progress, but initial support is 
there for a few backends - it needs added to other backends as we 
find people with access and knowledge of how to do it. 
Reinhard asked is there a way to ask for 
the datatype of a given column name? James said that wasn't 
possible as of the time of writing, but 
we planned on providing that so that designer can preset forms options

only.","2001-12-21","9"
"214","101","4","Reinhard said that, if GNUe Common was 
to replace the dbdriver in geas we would need fully functional 
introspection and schema creation methods - at least for postgres
James agreed. Jason pointed out that the schema 
introspection in postgresql is fairly complete. Reinhard thought 
schema creation methods to create 
tables and add columns and so on were more important initially than type 
checking. Jason admitted we don't have schema 
creation - of course, until we looked at having geas use our dbdrivers, 
they weren't necessary :) Neither Jason nor James thought it

was where he had applied his temporary fix, but there were still some 
minor formatting issues. Michael said the date problems were probably 
because pgsql 6.x used a non-ansi format for

only work on certain UI's. There was already a precedent in 
the way that the text-only UIs treated images - 
in curses mode i just 'ignore' it.

if GNUe provides a small set of widgets,

people can add widgets if they like

could even be in forms out of box
but would never be used in the base 
distribution of gnue apps. He felt that getting usable 
applications was more important 
than getting bunches of widgets :) - i think you can do 90% of what you
need with the widgets we have. Jason said that, in principle, 
a new widget would just be a new python 
package, but for technical reasons it could get messier than 
that. Derek said that like ALL free 
software projects, there was nothing stopping developers adding
whatever they wanted, and creating a branch if necessary. In practice, 
GNUe would often take the patch, though we
might state its not a good thing to use it if you want your 
applications to be in gnue - also if the maintainer stopped maintaining
it we would probably drop it or deem its BROKEN. Alternatively, 
we may find we like some of the new 
widgets and might be willing to support them even if the original 
author or others wont. Later, Charles suggested
maybe you could have widget definitions

javascript in HTML clients?. This would shift work from the 
server to the client. Jason said I would like 
to see a basic html client that worked under lynx and everything else - 
but could see an enhanced html driver that made it more ""friendly
"" to use, but required a more modern browswer. He also 
said GNUe might need to work with something 
as basic as a line-oriented forms client in which curses support isn't
there - it basically displays one question/line at a time.

trivial of things. Jason said that support for non-script

If we can solve the issues of distributing client code

putting the client binaries in shared location and the gfd's 
in shared location means clientless maintenance anyhow.
Peter said that if all the apps logic is 
in GEAS you don't have to upgrade GNUe Forms client as often

done by using Linux Terminal Server (LTSP). Peter also noted that 
at the moment, you can network install

Derek said maintenance ease is at top of 
list. Peter said that the 
Problem is that people assume that web-based is the only way to 
resolve client code distro problem, and referred to a 

British government paper on the subject.","2002-01-01","10"
"230","107","2","Jason said who knows, we may have 
self-updating forms clients someday :) Perry Lorier (Isomer) 
said client side code is very nice in the 
general case, but he was worried about security issues - 
While you can limit them with the client to 
certain abilities, you can't necessarily stop them connecting with 
access via ODBC then doing a ""DELETE FROM table"". 
He felt self-updating Forms clients could become a target for trojans 
or exploits. He agreed that a simple way of 
doing upgrades is a good idea [...] but make sure it does smart things 
like check a signature on the file. He gave some real-world 
and theoretical examples of automatic update sites being cracked. 
Peter said he felt the concept of a 
""mandatory upgrade"" for free s/w is an oxymoron. 
However, once an enterprise had conciously decided to accept an 
upgrade, they need the tools to distribute 
that fix as easily/quickly within their enterprise as 
possible.","2002-01-01","10"

Michael Maluck (madlocke) asked about the User Interface re-write of 
GNUe Forms, and how it would impact the HTML GNUe Forms client he was 
writing. James Thompson (jamest) said it's 
really just cleaning things up and making it play nice with your stuff
. Michael said what i am doing now 
is a different way of linking objects and integrate a layout manager...
some parts work already... want to show it to you after i added a few 
more things. He said you could now use either 
x,y coordinates and layout manager
He explained the creation of objects will 
be much more transparent - und separation between uibase und wxpython 
is more clean. James asked 
can you put in cvs? and does it break lots of stuff
Michael said he would CVS it tomorrow
. James asked is this working with 
the wxPython driver as well? Michael confirmed this had been 
re-written. He also wanted to get rid of 
this phase init stuff.... James said they had tried that, 
but kept having to kludge in work arrounds
. Michael suggested the main 
reason for phase init is because you don't have all information at 
time for object creation that is needed. right? James said 
yes - but it's not just at the UI level
. Database connections were also an issue. Michael said 
first thing i'll do is visual stuff, then 
look at the parser again. He should have the time to work on 
it now.","2002-01-02","10"
"232","109","1","Michael Maluck (madlocke)  reported 
i have some ugly problems with wxpython.. James Thompson 
(jamest) said the wxpython layout managers weren't 
very stable/usable yet. Michael 
said he might have to write his own. James said wxpython had 
issues in several areas - but we get a lot 
of bang for the buck in having a wxpython driver Michael asked 
if tkinter had been considered. 
James said i did some work in tcl/tk and 
quickly grew to dislike it. Bill Hamilton (Bill_H) 
said he had written some really powerful, 
readable code in just a few lines with it. Derek Neighbors 
(dnwork) said he thought wxPython was the 
best python UI out there assuming you want to EASILY maintian 
portablity - the issues it has are minor in comparision to the features 
it has, and were mainly with newer functionality.","2002-01-02","10"
"233","110","1","Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said GNUe Application Server (GEAS) 
should use multiple buffers to do includes 
for the parser - then you only need one pass to parse a GNUe 
Class Definition (.gcd). He posted part of the current GEAS code - 
kind of a depth-first algorithm - jsut keep
following the includes. However, this meant it had to use two 
passes. He said he would fix it to use 
something similar, giving some alternative, shorter, code in
flex. He commented hmmm, I am liking this 
flex guy already ;P.","2002-01-05","11"
"234","110","2","
The next day, Daniel wondered 
why does reinhard count lines himself instead of using the yylineno 
option?. Later, Reinhard Müller (reinhard) explained that, 
according to the flex documentation, it was 
an undocumented feature of Lex that does 
not appear in Flex or POSIX.","2002-01-05","11"
"235","110","3","Daniel had also asked 
I don;t get why he would define his own alphanum, etc. either when 
there's [:alphanum:], etc. classes that you can use. 
Later, Reinhard explained 
it wasn't documented in my copy of the flex manual and in 
any case, i'm not sure if non-gnu lex 
does have this feature too. He would be keen to change it 
if you can give me a pointer whether 
std lex understands [:alphanum:] or not. He admitted 
i have a lex incompatibility somewhere 
anyway, as the parser would not work on Solaris lex. The 
person with the problem had just installed flex (GNU lex) instead, 
as that was quicker than trying to trace the error.","2002-01-05","11"
"236","110","4","Earlier, Daniel said he had 
got through reading the flex manualand referred to 
the part about multiple inputs streams 
and their little example about how you could process includes in a 
depth first fashion. He wondered if GEAS could use this to 
save a whole 2nd pass from having to 
happen at all. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
we will not need includes at all - 
even if some gcd depend on others He explained 
some magic code in depend.c will decide 
in which order the gcd files should be processed. This was the 
reason for the two passes - first pass: 
register which symbols are defined in which file - then: find an order 
in which the files can be processed so that every symbol is defined 
before it is used - second pass: do the real parsing of the files, in 
the needed order. Daniel said 
that seems to make things harder to code. Reinhard agreed, but 
said it would make writing .gcd files easier. All of the gcds would 
need recompiling every time anything changed in any case - 
for example you could delete an object 
from a gcd file - and other gcd files could reference that object - 
so those other gcd files would become syntactically wrong - which you 
wouldn't know if you didn't process all of them. It was 
important to make .gcd files maintainable by non-programmers, if only 
for minor changes like adding a field to 
a class or so. Daniel said that includes were part of the Object 
Definition Language (ODL) that GNUe wanted to use. Reinhard hadn't seen 
the specification, but i would say if we 
can be compilant to odl except that we have less constraints then it 
would be better than to be die-hard odl compilant.","2002-01-05","11"
"237","111","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
i think it is better to be case insensitive in gcd files, 
saying it doesn't make sense IMHO to 
define a symbol foo and another symbol FOO and have different meanings 
for them. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
I always hated case-insensative systems
, noting that C and C++ don't 
seem to bug me to much with their case sensativity ;)","2002-01-06","11"
"238","111","2","Later, Holger Schurig (holsch) said 
Basically I like Turbo-Pascal and Delphi and they are both case-
insensitive. But then again I hate to look at other's source codes 
because they uppercase. Neil Tiffin (neilt) was more emphatic
- i hate upper case, and added
in direct marketing all upper case is 15% 
harder to read. Holger said 
I used mixed case for vars and uppercase for keywords in Pascal, 
that way the keywords did stand out, even without a syntax-highlithing 
editor. Neil asked do 
non-syntax-highlighting editors exist today? He thought 
the poor programmers that use those must feel 
like they live in the 18th century :)","2002-01-06","11"
"239","112","1","Holger Schurig (holsch) asked if GNUe had considered creating 
variable types that included not just the 
type ""char(64)"", but also how the label should be named, 
what lookup-table to use and so on. Whenever you use this variable 
type in a table or form, it would inherit this. Neil Tiffin 
(neilt) said we have that but forms designers 
have not warmed up to it - we treat it as a data element. 
Holger gave an example of what he meant - 
Basically the possibility to define lots of properties.. Neil 
said GNUe used a different 
structure. Holger said he would investigate further.","2002-01-06","11"

replication an load balancing for 
GNUe Application Server (GEAS). Holger Schurig (holsch) said 
load balancing is often done with 
transaction monitors ... even built in ones. Daniel explained 
that the dotGNU ppl want an application 
server but they were talking about writing it in C# to test out
their own complier. He said there was 

a good link about how IBM does load balancing with Open LDAP on 
the dotGNU developers list. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
he wanted to get GEAS working first before thinking about load 
balancing! Holger said he had seen a 
similar HA solution for SAP DB. He explained 
It used NBD (Network Block Device) from

the programs (forms, designer) tell 
me that i don't have the python xml libs, but i certainly have them.
 James Thompson (jamest) asked 
do you have the python xml or the python SIG PyXML installed
- you need the PyXML one. Christian said he had 
installed the debian package for ""
xml support for python 2.x"". James confirmed that was 
correct. Christian was running from CVS, 
but my last cvs update was about two weeks ago, haven't tried again 
since then. James asked do you 
still have python 1.5.x installed? Christian said 
no, that was my first guess, 1.5.x 
interfering with 2.1; i have uninstalled 1.5.x - didn't help,
but he wondered if there might be 
some environment variable that points to the old libraries?
James said he had had to remove python 1.5.x, and hadn't had any problems.
Christian said the setup.py had failed - he had fixed this, but only by
commenting out the ""import""s of 
the xml libs. James suggested 
to install pyxml from 
source. Christian agreed - 
that should be the easiest way - though i don't like it on a system 
with usually clever package management :-). James was still 
bemused why he hadn't had problems with a very similar set-up. 
Christian said if i find the error, i'll 
drop a mail to the list(s).","2002-01-07","11"

we got an application server contributed by a company
and are in the process of adapting it to our needs. 
James Thompson (jamest) said designer 
works ok although 
our mouse support is alpha quality at best wrt dragging widgets 
arround. He confirmed that python was the preferred/only
scripting language so far - 
we've talked about support other languages inside triggers
but we've put no effort into making it happen. Christian
siad don't worry about other languages; 
it's better to have one language supported well than having a dozen 
unmaintained. but you already know that. :). He wondered 
btw, why have you choosen corba over 
xmlrpc or soap?. James said that Jason Cater was working 
on GNU-RPC as part of GNUe Common

you do database drivers, so GNUe could ultimately support
all three and more.","2002-01-07","11"

when it supports it :) He confirmed the XML would be a fairly 
abstract list of forms, without physical mark-up - it would be up to the

workflow engine - but for now its simply an application container 
to launch other forms and reports and such. He asked if 
it could be made to do actions other than just 
calling runForm or runReport,

run on it, I suppose I can ;) Derek said he was thinking much 
the same. The licensing was a mixture of GNU Public License and GNU 
Lesser Public License, and it looks like 
they readily support php/python/C/C++. He felt that 
for some enterprises that are a little 
larger it might be easier to sell sap db over postgres - as there is a

He wondered if he could test in directly in python without having 
to use GNUe Forms. James Thompson (jamest) said

'wizards' were broken ? as it wasn't working even 
without the IBM DB2 driver. James said the wizards might 
have problems with DB2 as 
i don't think we had any way to do introspection on db2
because none of us had it - so the drivers may not work w/ 
the wizards anyway. Jason said this could be added 
if you can point me to some docs

libraries, which were not available on 
windows for free. James and Jason said Oracle was the same. 
Derek said it was sad as the db2server 
license fee is per processor which i thought pretty cool - now they 
just ding you for seat licenses by making you have CLI libs.

in the process of designing an 
alternative to .Net and Hailstorm - The premise being that webservices 
have a place in the future, regardless of what anyone thinks, and that 
MS shouldn't stand un-answered in that arena - that control of network 
authentication through passport and control of internet execution 
environment through .Net - even if it's only the potential control - 
would be devastating. .Net consisted of an ""intermediate 
langauge"" called IL and languagues that compiled down to it, plus 
a set of libraries for any component that
communicates with XML-RPC or SOAP.","2001-12-10","12"
"258","121","2","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that he thought Microsoft .Net was 
a threat to free software,

software is to put power back in that very persons hand. But 
he said he would applaud (loudly) the 
efforts of dotGNU to not be like mono and just follow in .net's shadow
 Barry agreed, but said ignoring 
it won't make it go away, so we have to face it and turn it around on 
them. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said DotGNU's main focus was
freedom from Microsoft .Net while also 
putting together a better system and downwardly supporting M$ .NET - 
so ppl can choose different providers. Jason Cater (jcater)

as ""freedom"" period!. GNU 
as a whole was more than just anti-Microsoft.","2001-12-10","12"

over-hyped - the applications that matter 
(payroll, human resources, procurement and finance) they run on an ibm 
mainframe w/ windows boxes that act as dumb terminals [...] the 
technology from 30 years ago is still winning [...] cause it does its 
job and when someones po or pay check is on the line, people
dont mess with that. Barry agreed - 
I think Unix is far better in basic form 
than any new OS out there.. Derek said he feared that DotGNU 
could be seen as free software validating 
that moving the business model from license fees to service to use 
(leasing) is ok. The business model for free software such 
as GNUe was service-based, but the service was the 
bandwith, processor and hardisk 
not the software itself. The current GPL could not prevent free 
software ASPs (Application Service Providers) from keeping their 
modifications private, which could help them to acheive the kind of 
lock-in that GPL was meant to prevent. Jason said 
I don't think derek is saying ""modify 
the license""... I think he's saying that if software goes the 
webservices route we WILL lose freedoms... we can't stop it, but 
LET'S NOT PROMOTE IT. Barry clarified 
DotGNU is not simply about ASP's - 
that's not even our focus and it never has been.","2001-12-10","12"

situation: what if the gov't mandates the use of a digital identity - 
would you prefer one that is Free and has multiple vendors, 
or one that is not and has only one? Having to own or access 
proprietary software as a pre-requisite of being an effective citizen 
would be a bad thing. He said The model 
is coming, one way or another - we have to decide whether we want to 
influence it or not. Derek said 
i can live with that answer.","2001-12-10","12"

GNUe could benefit from an official relationship - starting with our

looking for in an App Server - as that's quite a broad term?
Daniel said same thing we are, imho - a 
general purpose app server where you csn describe the objects and 
execute their methods, etc.. Later, Barry asked about 
any network protocol work. Derek 
mentioned GNU-RPC (as discussed in 

), which was intended to be an 
implementation agnostic rpc - i.e. an abstraction that speaks soap, xml-rpc, corba, 
dcom etc etc etc. At the moment, this was being written in python, GNUe's

to continue for 2-3 weeks. He explained that they had rewritten 
the code that parses GNUe Class Definitions, but 
some parts of geas use the new

i have to keep the new one 
compatible with the old as long as both are active - even for

Jason Cater (jcater) said he didn't see how 
GEAS is related to generic application serving, as it was a 
fairly specific Object-to-Relational mapper 
with nifty features. He said I don't 
think you want GEAS to become overly all-inclusive or 
over-reaching. Daniel said well this is 
really reinhard's call and we all know GEAS needs help. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said the 
design goal of geas is to be the application server of the GNUe 
project and do everything GNUe needs - if others find they can use 
geas for other purpose this is their decision - i will neither talk 
them into it nor out of it - i would rather give them objective 
information if they ask for some - and of course i will be happy if 
they find geas even more useful than it was initially designed for
. He didn't know how other Application Servers worked, so couldn't 
say whether GEAS was generic or not, but said 
that's not important for me. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
i dont think i see it as being 'object neutral'
 - i.e. i expect it to always derive 
its objects off gnue definitions. Daniel said 
I think we should use odl definitions. 
Derek admitted i am starting to have 'mixed' 
feelings on geas and wondered if it should just be 
a transport layer and remote methods 
and not bother with mapping a relational database to objects, at least to 
just get something up and running to start with.","2002-01-11","12"

quick hack and 
no one likes it. Jason said that Derek 
had only suggested that maybe more effort could go 
into the transport and remote methods code instead of so much time being put 
in the object-to-relational part. Daniel said 
that part has been done. He said 
the only problem leaves the current code is much to be desired and no one 
really wants to build on it but rewrite it.","2002-01-11","12"
"265","122","4","Later, Derek said btw: i have ALWAYS ALWAYS 
ALWAYS ALWAYS stated im pro designing software - but over all i will take 
something that works today than something that is most beautiful architected 
that never sees light of day. He felt that the priority was to get 
GEAS working with GNUe Common, both for database access and RPC, and 
get trigger language for both geas and forms 
sketched out. He said if that stuff gets 
doneand we are still at a stalled point then i say perhaps make a non object 
n tier option. He added in many ways i 
think we should be doing it all in python. Phil Cole (fil_c) was
worried about the speed issue with python (but leave 
that until after it's done in python). Jason said 
python is the perfect prototyping language - because it is so easy to pull 
slow python code out and replace w/optimized C code.","2002-01-11","12"
"266","123","1","Jason Cater (jcater) said that he had written
a fairly complex ""
diagnostics"" script [...] it will show you all the 
pythons you have installed and whether each one has the 
requirements for GNUe. This would help make support 
queries relating to the the Python dependancies for GNUe 
much easier.","2002-01-11","12"
"267","124","1","Jason Cater (jcater) announced he was working on an 
extension to GNUe Designer to handle GNUe Naviagtor.
This was proving easier than expected and showed that 
Designer was less of a ""hack
"" than I realized. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
asked if there was any documentation for Navigator yet.","2002-01-11","12"
"268","125","1","Jason Cater (jcater) explained that 
Designer 0.1.0 is our first hack at a visual design environment 
for GNUe Forms and, eventually, other parts of GNUe. 
He explained that, at the time of writing, 
Designer could only ""peek"" 
into the table structure of Postgres when using ""Wizards
"", an automatic method of generating forms.
Once you were in the main design 
session you tell Designer what ""text box"" is associated 
with what postgres ""field"" and Designer takes your word
for it. Kenneth Reiszner (kreiszner) asked what happened 
if you got it wrong. Jason said Designer wouldn't check, but 
Forms would simply forward to you the 
error message that the database backend gave it when you 
ran it. He said he was in the process of 
adding drag-and-drop support so it shows you the tables in a side 
window and all the fields of that table.","2002-01-11","12"
"269","125","2","Jason explained some Designer/Forms terminology:","2002-01-11","12"
"270","125","3","Jason hoped he wasn't putting everyone to sleep, but several
lurkers confirmed they were listening in intently! He explained
when using Combo Boxes, you have 
to specify a datasource that will be used to populate it
. When opening a sample form in Designer, 
 the first thing you should see is 
a window with a tree on the left and a gridded area on the 
right.","2002-01-11","12"
"271","125","4","Derek and Jason got Kenneth and Phil Cole (phil_c) set up 
with a Designer installation. Phil reported that 
designer has just wiped out 
helloworld2.gfd when it had a problem saving a change i'd made 
. Jason pointed to the Designer README, which warned 
that WARNING: GNUe Designer 0.1.0 is 
not perfect code. Odds are, it will crash on you at some point 
(many points?), so if using on production forms, work from
a copy and save often.","2002-01-11","12"
"272","125","5","Later, Kenneth said he had been looking at the Contact 
Manager sample form, and my 1st 
q is how is the data stored for address when there are multiple 
address types? Jason explained 
the ""Address"" area of the screen is a single block
even though the block only displays one record on the screen at 
a time, it can hold multiple records - that is what the < and 
> buttons are for. Kenneth clarified 
I mean how is it stored in the 
postgres db in multiple tables or what? Jason said 
yes - each block corresponds to a table
. Kenneth said then there is 
some kind of sql going on in the backgroud or at least relational 
arangement.","2002-01-11","12"
"273","125","6","Kenneth also asked How do you 
create a boxes and buttons? Jason dismissed boxes as 
screen eye candy, but explained 
how to create them. Buttons were the same, 
however a button can be associated with a ""trigger""
which is a piece of python code. He suggested 
I'd stick with basic forms (boxes, 
labels, and entries) and learn how that works before digging 
into buttons and triggers - simple forms did not need 
them.","2002-01-11","12"
"274","125","7","Jason fully recognised that we 
still have some bugs to work out :). Kenneth said that 
When MS Access first came out MS 
had the audacity to chg. $100 for a program that had bugs 
everywhere and much functionality missing so don't feel 
badly.","2002-01-11","12"
"275","125","8","
The next day, Kenneth asked 
When you are designing in forms, how do 
you create a field that is not already there, i.e. do you have to 
create the field or table in Postgres and then access it in forms or 
what?. Derek (derek) said 
You can right click on the form, and i think there is an option new->
then you select the object like -entry- and it will place it on the 
form (top left corner i think). Then you can drag it where you want it
and open the property editor and you can change the properties that 
bind it to data. This also meant 
You can have entry fields that are NOT tied to databases.
This could be used for calculated or derived fields which then updated 
via a trigger. He added 
if you are doing a NEW form i woudl use the 
'wizard' as you simply point it to a database and it would look 
up all the fields for you.","2002-01-11","12"
"276","125","9","Kenneth asked how you would tie a trigger to a field. Derek said 
I know there is a 'trigger' editor in 
deisgner but i havent used it yet. I think you right mouse click and to 
add trigger you create the type, go to shared triggers on the right hand 
tree and do right mouse click and choose add new shared trigger. Then double 
click on the new trigger branch that was created, change the name property 
to something meaningful, then go to a widget you want to bind the trigger 
to and double click it (on the tree in the left). It will bring up property 
dialog. Then change the tab to events. On the event tab you should get diff 
events like pre-focus-out and such. Then you can set it to call the trigger 
you just created. Then in the trigger editor you can write code for the 
trigger. However, he warned i think the 
designer in the 0.1.0 release is pretty buggy with regards to triggers
.","2002-01-11","12"
"277","125","10","Later, Derek expressed a need for a designer 
users guide w/ purdy screenshots. Jason said 
we hare the start of GNUe Designer's Guide: Forms in designer/docs
- I was gonna wait until the new Designer before adding screenshots. 
He later noted that hopefully by the end of the day, 
designer will have a real event/trigger editor.","2002-01-11","12"
"278","125","11","Kenneth started using the GNUe Designer wizard - 
should I be in blank form? Derek said yes, 
then click on menu item File -> New -> From Wizard.
This should launch a dialog box. In the box should be 'simple form wizard' 
(highlight it if it isnt already) and click 'run wizard' button - it should 
launch another dialog. Type 'Test Form' in the title and from the connection drop 
down box, choose the one that has your gnue database - i.e. it should say '[gnue]' 
at the end - then click continue. You would then be asked for database
user name and password. Kenneth had some initial problems, as his postgres
database wasn't starting up automatically, but later reported 
I got the wizard to work in gfdesigner..

"279","126","1","Michael Maluck (madlocke) said he was 
working on layout managers for the HTML client for GNUe 
Forms. He said now boxlayout and 
gridbaglayout is working - much code is from java's awt and swing. 
It now spits out absolute x,y cooridates as relative ones too
. Jason Cater (jcater) said they had been holding off making 
any changes to the main GNUe Forms client until they saw Michael's 
changes. Michael gave an example of the XML structure he was using 
within the HTML client. Jason asked whether 
you are only working in the UI stuff currently? Michael 
confirmed he had been doing some work on the event system, but the 
priority was the layout manager - other 
things are ideas i have to discuss. He was trying to make 
sure that basic ui stuff is really in 
UIbase and not in UIwxpython - he wanted 
to do wx and web at same time so i don't 
put ugly dependencies in the drivers. Jason said other people 
could help out where possible - that's one 
reason we would like to see the code. Michael said he would 
send it tomorrow - not all widgets are 
supported yet, but i think as soon as the basic stuff works good it 
is no problem to add other widgets, although 
scroll pane can be something more 
difficult for web driver maybe.","2002-01-13","12"
"280","126","2","
Two days later, Michael e-mailed the files to James Thompson 
(jamest) and Jason. He said that the HTML code 
it is a bit further than wx. 
James said once we get this stuff 
folded into cvs then we'll be able to lend a hand w/ cleanup - 
as the return of multi ui support will be huge. Michael 
confirmed the layout managers spit 
out absolute coordinates too ;) so it will be usable for curses
. For the moment, he was doing absolute positioning in HTML 
using css absolute positons... this will 
change later maybe... James said 
we'll look it over - probably bundle up a common/forms release - or at 
least tag cvs for such a release - then start merging in ideas and 
code.","2002-01-13","12"

Derek Neighbors (derek) said i like 
how you made object navigator 'floating' but i think it should be 
'dockable' i.e. you should be able to dock it where it used to be

Three days later, Jason Cater (jcater) pointed at  

one or 
two new screen shots from GNUe Designer. He explained

to automatically create ""Entries"". Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) thought this is pretty damn 
cool, and that he would have to start writing the User Guide 
soon, as Jason was adding features faster than he could document them! 
He confirmed that i ASSUME that the schema
tab isnt 'odbc' friendly, as ODBC couldn't do introspection to 
find out what tables and fields were available. Jason confirmed this, 
but said it shouldn't crash - it should just 
stay blank Derek suggested it 
might be worth either throwing a dialog box or some other kind 
of cant introspect error message.","2002-01-13","12"

its MUCH different than i expected

this is what jamest and I needed at first but 
I expect GNUe Nav to be several different

--install-gnome-menu will actually install shortcuts to the forms 
in your GNOME menu - this is completely different than just plain 
gnue-nav. I expect later on to have a menu plugin to forms - not 
sure if you see where I'm going or not. Derek said he was, 
for himself, somewhat disappointed as 
if its not contained w/ in app is not a big step for me personally
. However, its a damn good start 
though - as just getting an xml definition and having it readable is 
a big deal - the navigator portion is definitely functional from what

with forms, reports, etc. how does this fit in with GNUe, what things 
will constitute an official GNUe package?. He said he was 
working on sofwtare to manage a TRIO 
program - I wanto use forms and convert our stinking PHP code to using 
GNUe Forms + python. I was wonder how such a solution would fit into 
the grand scheme of GNUe - any ideas?. He said 
I suppose we are going to have generic 
packages that one would extend to a specific enterprise?.","2002-01-16","12"
"285","129","2","Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that several GNUe team members 
had used the GNUe tools for particular projects, but they were 
not for redistribution - the reason why 
is because they were bolted on to existing systems i.e. highly 
customized and dependant on existing proprietary systems. They 
were thus not a sensible basis for a generic GNUe Application under 
the GNU Public License. Daniel said that 
this app that I have is useful to programs all over the country 
(potentially anyway ;) )","2002-01-16","12"
"286","129","3","Derek said that he and Neil Tiffin had discussed how accrediting
'official' gnue apps might work,

at this point write what you need, but try to adhere to 'similar' 
philosphies - or if you want it to be official right of box step up 
and be the first :) i.e. force us to make the decisions we havent had 
to yet :) This wasn't just procrastination, 
as on many items we ahve 'discussed' but 
havent been happy w/ a single answer and we felt it best in some 
respects to let the first 'application authors' hit the wall
so we could have more 'real' data in which to base our 
decisions. He added that, as at the time of writing, provided 
an application was released under the GNU Public License and used GNUe 
Form Definitions, there is good chance it 
will get plenty of press from us :).","2002-01-16","12"
"287","130","1","Stuart Bain (stbain) said I think I found the 
""Killer app"" that will bring GNUe into the limelight
One of his clients was a car dealership who was very unhappy with their
relationship with one of their system suppliers, who was 
pretty much gouging them for support, installation, 
and maintenance on obsolete technology - it's nothing for some 
dealerships to spend up to $45K to add 12 users at an existing location
. The system supplier maintains complete 
control over the machines [...] refuses to give out root passwords or 
work with third party vendors to implement new technologies or add new 
sites. He wondered is GNUe ready to 
build a Dealer Management System on? Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
said you could hack up a 2-tier app
with the GNUe Tools as they stood at time of writing. He believed  
that ncurses is probably old and 
rotting away but noted there's going 
to be a UI rewrite soon which should reinstate support for it. 
Stuart said that capitalizing on their existing 
hardware (dumb terminals) would be a big selling point and added 
oh... BTW... they're willing to fund us :)
He also asked do you know off the top of your 
head how much it would take to port forms to a java swing interface?
 Daniel said we have a Java forms 
client - however - the proper thing to do would be to write java ui 
plugin and he noted swing is 
non-free. Jason Cater (jcater) said his original involvement 
with GNUe had been due to dissatisfaction with 
actually writing a swing-based forms app. However, 
it is certainly possible to port forsm to 
java/swing - actually, we consider the Python forms to be a ""
reference"" implementation not necessarily the ""only"" 
implementation of GNUe Forms. Stuart was worried about the 
implications of having to install the Forms client and the python/
wxpython dependancies on each PC. Jason said 
we have precompiled Windows binaries on the website that contains 
EVERYTHING. For GNU/Linux, you could either 
use diskless terminals such as the 
Linux Terminal Server Project or create a 
""static"" python + wx install then tar it up and untar on all 
the other machines - in effect creating a binary image. 
Daniel said long term I would hope you would 
want to use geas and define your business objects and methods, but ubtil 
then you could just use the forms client and a database and write som 
triggers and have a nice app. Stuart said the idea was to 
have the entire dealer base in the country throw
their weight behind the development effort(s) - so we would definitely 
want to use a mature GEAS and use 3 tier design. He added 
I also discussed the problem w/ multiple vendors... 
GM, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, etc... they all have their proprietary protocols 
to access information from their networks - so I'm also thinking something 
along the lines of an Automotive Markup Language - AML ;) I'm thinking we 
can work with OASIS and try to lobby for some support in that area
Jason had to run, but suggested that Stuart talked to Derek Neighbors.","2002-01-17","13"
"288","130","2","Later, Derek suggested if you are on 
windows dont use cvs - instead grab the .exe's - that way you dont

said we are PRIMED to run on vt100 as 
soon as curses support is back and said 
i think what you are asking is DEFINITELY 
do able w/ two tier as it sits right now. He personally didn't 
see any value in a java/swing client - 
if you wanted java, i would write from scratch in java. He 
said he was not sure what the questions 
were in some regards i.e. is stbain asking can this be done or asking 
for us to do it? Jason said he was 
not really sure. Daniel said hey,

Baumann (chillywilly) said we don't have

So does GNU enterprise use WxWindows 
only? (and gtk through this?) - I thought it had a pluggable architecture
? Jason Cater (jcater) said the wxPython version 
is currently our reference implementation - next 
up will be a curses-based plugin followed by an html. They had 
had a curses-based version previously, but had not been keeping it up to 
date. Miguel asked Is GNUE end-user ready? I 
am going to ask someone at Ximian to make rpms ;-). Jason said 
the forms client is in production use several 
places and the designer ide is coming 
along nicely. Miguel noted Ok, so you 
are not reusing anything like glade (totally understandable).
Jason said we have an entry on that in our faq - 
glade is EXCELLENT for designing GTK apps - 
but that is not what we do. Miguel asked 
Ok, so what should I subscribe to if I want

He also was still thinking of getting rid 
of this phaseinit... but not now.... James said they had 
previously had a single init system 
that just didn't work for our multipart system. He hoped to 
fold the layout manager into the current 
code base w/ a few changes - then see about adding in the html stuff 
along side our current UI rewrite. They hadn't progressed with 
this so far as it was really dependent 
upon the html clients needs - jcater and I have discussed it somewhat 
- but nothing on paper yet. They had been 
talking about having a single process on 
the web server - using sessoins/cookies to driver mutliple UIhtml 
sessions for different users.","2002-01-18","13"
"293","133","1","James Thompson noted that he was 
thinking about keeping the number of entities to a minimum
in the GNUe Definition files. Michael Maluck (madlocke) asked 
what to do with special styles
for layout managers, such as box layouts that 
can do layouting horizontal or vertical
. James said we could either allow 
optional attributes or we could provide some general attribute that 
takes a string of values. Jason Cater (jcater) opined that 
it critical that we keep the number of tags 
to a minimum. James explained that 
my goal however was for forms to be able to fall back when it hits 
something it didn't know how to handle - for instance when curses and 
wxpython both worked, the curses client didn't know how to do 
dropdowns. Since dropdown was an entry style it didn't matter - the 
forms with dropdown still worked on curses and still did input 
validation - you just couldn't pick from a list. If we had done 
<dropdown> as it's own thing then the form would not have 
displayed at all. Michael said 
i was thinking of something like a widget hierarchy - means that these 
fall backs can be automated. He explained 
if the ui does not explicitly say: i can 
support a tag that tag falls back until a good widget class is found
. James said this was basically what they were trying to do - 
I'm still of a mind set to keep the number 
of tags low to make this easier to program.","2002-01-18","13"
"294","133","2","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
the more complex the widget set teh harder to support a myriad of UI's

for (business) are old curses terminals [...] a little hard to 'learn' 
but once you learn VERY efficient to use. There were still a 
lot of dumb terminal applications still in use in large organisations. 
He added i am NOT ANTI gui - just saying 
all the bells and whistles of complex widget sets dont == better 
software. James said what I like 
now is that I can show a .gfd to a non-programmer and they can 
""get"" it. Derek agreed -

hooks for those who ""insisted"" they need them. 
Derek added but we make it a 'use at own 
risk' and we dont use it for GNUe Apps that are official
Michael said ok. then we need some docs/
specs about this and asked whether 
the widgets supported at the moment by gnuef define the standard 
already or is it too much/less?. Derek said 
the current thinking is start simple - 
lets get entry/label/etc working WELL - and supported on many 
different UI's - and used in applications - then lets see what other 
widgets could be really beneficial and such and look at implementing 
them i.e. classic lets do a few things really well instead of a lots 
of things really bad.","2002-01-18","13"

I don't know if it can be used event-driven
. Derek Neighbors (derek) said that didn't matter, as 
forms has its own events system.
He felt it would be cool to offer 3 diff 
curses modes :) as originally we were offering pyncurses (whose maintainer 
actually worked on gnue for a bit) then we switched to curses that comes 
w/ python [...] so to offer newt version would be sweet if got all three 
up and moving - it woudl REALLY show the power of gnue - yeah we have 
'character based' forms - which style you want? curses, pyncurses or newt?

"303","137","3","Holger felt somewhat frustrated that 
Forms are designed for character based terms (i.e. absolute coordinates,) 
but they don't run on them ... as at the time of writing. Derek said 
they did - i promise they did - in fact if you 
grab an old release from the website it will work with curses. 
Holger said he had considered this, 
but forms without a layout manager just suffer as soon as it comes to i18n. 
Some languages use lots of more characters than english ... :-(
Derek said i dont think that layout manager is 
that huge of deal personally. Holger disagreed -  
The problem is that many english words are short, but they are 
long in hungarian or german, which could make labels look ugly.
Derek said point is you have the source - 
if it looked horrid in your language w/ a little work you could fix it :)

our Layout Editor is drag-n-drop + toolbar at top plus we have full schema 
introspection support plus a real syntax-highlighting code editor
plus a data source editor. He clarified that ""schema""
meant for relational sources, it's ""tables""

I'm stuck with Windows Powerbuilder and I wanted to know that there was 
at least something sane out there :) Jason Cater (jcater) said 
the GNUe tools were a direct comparison to 
Oracle Forms and PowerBuilder. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said
nah, GNUe is better :). Jason 
said they supported a wide range of database back-ends - 
Postgres, MySQL, DB2, Oracle, SAP-DB, 
Interbase, Informix, any ODBC. Rob, all embarassed, asked
is the dreaded MS SQL Server somewhere in there? :)
. Jason said we are working on an ADO 
driver - but it's supported via ODBC at the moment. He explained
ADO is supposedly MS Server's native interface 
format. The ODBC support was slightly limited, as 
we use a public domain ODBC driver which is 
lacking introspection. This meant 
our Designer can't automatically create forms using ODBC.","2002-01-21","13"

As midnight came, he explained that Designer 
is our IDE - Forms runs what Designer creates. Rob asked about

Jason said as right now, try not to make 
mistakes :) Rob said well, I can accept 
that - Powerbuilder is that way and it will never get better ;).
Jason said actually, the client software is in 
production use at my office and a few other guy's offices - my IT team is 
starting to use designer - but it's fairly new. Now the other tools

we are not LOCKED into CORBA - the docs are slightly dated as you 
noted - CORBA was ONLY transport that was stable at time of those docs
on Linux - now SOAP and XML-RPC are showing signs of promis.
We are working on an abstraction layer for RPC - so much like GEAS

database driver supported by GNUe Common - 
it updates your connection file and grabs the driver. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) asked 
Can Debian packages have a 'one of many' dependancy?
i.e. Forms depends on one or more of Common-mysql, common-odbc, 
etc. Derek said 
techinically forms doesnt - as you can make forms that dont connect to 
databases. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested 
then you'd have a Recommends: or 
Suggests: tag. Derek said 
im not huge fan of lots of packages but its necessary to make things 
more simple and we will get gnue part of 'tasksel' or whatever it is

own apt type tool to do them. If this was the case, 
we would not write something like it 
from scratch but rather would extend it - but thats a full other

you know the field names then 
you can look at

with a serverside method - actually you don't need a method at all 
here [...] you only need a client that requests and reads and outputs 
the data. Maurizio said this had just been an example - 
my final idea is to have all insert and 
cheks methos serverside and call them from remote client. 
Reinhard said he understood the idea of server side check methods, but 
didn't see how server side insert methods would work 
because for insert you need to provide 
the data. However, he noted that

said that if this was happening at start up, it was because 
when we need an empty record we run a query 
like the one above and it returns a blank resultSet. I don't recall why 
we did it this way so if it's giving you problems we can readdress the 
issue. However that query looks like normal operatoin. The form on startup
typically doesn't pull the data from the table until you request a query.
Instead it creates a single empty new record (via that query). To get it 
to pull your data you have to entry query mode then execute the query

then thrash out what was discussed - see what worked what didnt and

sourceforge for example of thousands of projects that have no code and 
nothing working cause they are still 'designing'. Calum said 
there were also plenty a product with no 
obvious design behind it. He asked whether there was

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said using db2 
here w/ forms is becoming more a necessity. However, getting 
free DB2 database drivers for a Windows client looked impossible - 
so i think im regelated to use ODBC. 
However, the current ODBC code in GNUe Common couldn't do introspection 
to find out what tables and fields were in a database, which was needed 
to be able to use the wizards in Designer. Jason Cater (jcater) said he 
had been thinking about this - as our 
introspection support is really nothing more than a set of selects
, you could use the introspection code from the non-ODBC 
version of the database driver and 
allow odbc to use the db-specific select statements to do 
introspection.","2002-01-28","14"

over ODBC, and certainly no experience w/DB2 system catalogs, so that

Jason had not had any way to test it out 
before checking it in. Designer couldn't see the 
SYSCAT.TABLES table it needed for introspection, but this might be 
because the user name and password Derek was using didn't have the 
necessary privaleges, or because Derek was using such an old version 
of DB2 - but old versions of DB2 were notoriously long-lived.

far, and they would try again tomorrow.","2002-01-28","14"

the one in use by Universal Server but I guess you use the other :)
. Derek confirmed sysibm.systables 
works!. Jason noted that this was 

documented on the web. This appeared to relate to older versions 
of DB2 such as Derek's. Derek said that, for bigger databases 
we might hav eto have 'subclassed' 
providers for version - so you might have provider db2_5_5, provider 
db2_6_0, provider db2_7_0 or whatever if there were diffs.

when executing a code fragment in 
python, you can specific a global namespace and a local 
namespace - iirc, we currently only pass in a global 
namespace. I'm thinking we can use the distinction to our 
advantage - the global namespace always points to a 
universally maintained trigger sandbox (which contains no 
""local"" references). James said he liked 
the sound of this - now when to 
init this puppy - if I put in forms code then every app would
have to have trigger init code that wanted triggers. 
Jason thought this would be better done in the base 
application. However, he had been 
thinking for a while that we need a ""common"" class 
that all top-level GObj's subclass from and this

on it. In general, most GNUe users/project team 
members preferred file-based methods of setting parameters, 
as referred to in 

Jason said that even with a 
completely db-based solution... you would still need 
connections.conf or equivalent to tell the client where the 
system management database was! He wasn't sure there was a 
fundamental difference. They had already discussed 
having forms stored in databases
but as an OPTION :). Calum liked the sound of this.","2002-01-30","14"
"344","158","1","Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked

temporarily on hold - due to pressing needs elsewhere.","2002-01-30","14"
"345","159","1","Jan Ischebeck (Jan) demonstrated a basic Forms client he had 
written in PHP. Everyone was very impressed. James Thompson (jamest) 
asked are you going to attempt to 
reimplement forms in PHP or just the UI part?. Jan said 
I thought of a complete reimplementation
. Jan said the motivation for re-implementing Forms in 
PHP was that its. faster to it in one 
language.","2002-01-30","14"

Issue 5, Section 2,
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) reported that 
my ODMG book came in the mail today - 
""The Object Data Standard: OMDG 3.0"". Andrew 
Mitchell (ajmitch) asked what are your 
GEAS plans now? Daniel said he wasn't sure - 
I have some material to digest first - 
but this ODMG book should help things a bit","2002-02-01","15"
"348","160","2","
Several days later, Daniel Baumann confirmed he was still working 
through the ODMG book, making notes on all 
the goodies in my book, which I plan to make available to some interested
GNUe hackers....ummm within limits of copyright ;) Several people
tried to guess what ODMG stood for, with varying degrees of obscenity. 
Daniel explained he was reading about 
metadata and the ODL Schema repository - in hopes of making a GEAS that 
doesn't suck, but felt the ODMG 
metadata stuff is confusing. Jason said 
what d'ya expect with objects? something simple????. Daniel 
rretorted plz - objects rock - it's not that 
complicated  - I dun figured it out. The intention was to avoid  
having to design an object framework for GEAS from scratch, 
but just write a Free implementation
of an existing standard. He thought that the 
fun part will be converting all those gcds and doing a proper design 
there ;P. Jason commented that I don't 
want to be around when you tell reinhard his gcd lexer is shit. 
Daniel said it's not - the lexer will 
provide a good base - what it parses things into might change though - 
we need some real objects - not hacked up andrewm C structs 
;P.","2002-02-01","15"
"349","160","3","He said that using ODMG would allow you to 
define schema to store the objects and then 
you put that schema in the tables of the relational db - you want to add 
a new object you just add to the ""repository"". This 
meant you could write it once and forget 
about the damn db and just use objects. This would take longer 
to design, but not if you just use an already
made standard ;). He noted ODMG is 
pretty language neutral, you even do python bindings if you wanted to

"350","161","1","Following on from  

and 
,
James Thompson (jamest_) said 
i need custom menus soon (before the 15th of this month :( ).
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked 
has anyone looked at the XForms  standard?. James said 
long ago - it didn't (at that time) fit
forms target - and IIRC was pretty complex. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said i need menus too :)
. He said navigator is neat 
and all - but it wont work for production stuff imho. He 
added i think the basis is right - its
a matter of reading that file into a gfd as a menu - not a separate 
thing that hangs off the side. What he would like 
is gpd file loaded into existing menu
 at start-up. You could then decide whether to 
a. only have one form in the framework
open at a time - b. allow multiple to be open - c. allow multiples 
but contain them like an MDI app all within the 'container'.
He felt a or c make most sense - and a 
is probably easies to do right away and would perform more like 
traditional app andd make easiest for 'curses' or other limited 
UI's.","2002-02-01","15"
"351","161","2","Later, Jason Cater (jcater) said he disagreed - having multiple 
forms open was equally valid. He said 
I'd prefer to see 'Submenu items' that are attached to 'triggers'
and leave navigator as a separate tool, the way that Oracle
and SAP did it. James explained 
what I was wanting to do in menu system - GMenu's make a tree - they
have things like Text, HotKey, Trigger - so that all menu items 
fire triggers and that these triggers have default names so that 
a form could overwrite the std trigger with a custom one. 
For menu placement, menu tags in the XML needed to place themselves 
in the normal drop-down menus - find 
File.Save and put me after it. Because 
GMenu would be based upon GObj 
then the entire default system menu and 
form customizations would be exposed to the trigger system.
He added my initial thoughts are to put 
this in common - so that eventually any gnue app could define it's 
menus this way.","2002-02-01","15"
"352","161","3","Jason asked did you see the pic of 

SAP Easy Access screenshot someone posted? that's what I'd like 
to have ;). James noted I'm 
pretty sure that I don't want a toolbar entry that isn't on the 
menu so I think the toolbar system should just contain links to 
menu entries Menu items could 
have a toolbarPosition and toolbarIcon attribute that if filled add 
to the toolbar. This would mean that 
all toolbar entries must be on the menu,
they can't exist without a menu pick. Jason agreed - 
imho a mouse is 'always' optional 
equipment :). James asked 
should we include the toolbar def as part of the menu def - or have 
a completely seperate GToolBar that sits seperate but acts to only 
""fire"" the menu picks. Jason preferred the option 
that would also allow us to provide 
""custom"" toolbars if that was desirable. James 
gave some examples to clarify what he meant.","2002-02-01","15"
"353","161","4","Derek (derek) returned, and noted 
the sap thing is ok, if the current navigator was cleaned up to 
that kind of polish it might be pretty cool. He felt 
we will need ability to load gpd's as 
menus directly into the 'framework' - but i see value in a 'pretty'
navigator as well. In his view, 
navigator is hard to navigate for 
complex menus :) - i.e. unless 
you know exactly where things are under the current navigator they 
are hard to find, although  
the current navigator is perfect for curses world almost 
untouched :).","2002-02-01","15"
"354","162","1","Possibly rembering the discussions from 

Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) noted nickr is 
supposed to be writing something for Document Management for GNUe. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said maybe I should actially
produce some docustore code - When I finish ratmaze and poplar I'll 
work on docustore. He added ratmaze is 
sort of like docustore actually - more like 'projectstore' 
He went on to say i just realized hov I can 
save a lot of time with diplicated work - i'll rewrite the docustore 
spec to use ratmaze's metadata structure - and then use ratmaze as a 
prototype. He explained I keep all my 
projects and data and such in a directory tree like proj/blah/blah - 
ratmaze basically adds metadata to this structure as separately stored 
xml files - also enables journal entries and thumbnails and such
. This meant he could have 'homepages' 
for my projects and have them all browsable - maintaining the same 
directory structure as the projects and allowing other info to be 
associated with them.","2002-02-03","15"
"355","162","2","Michael Dean (mdean) wondered if it could 
be implemented within DCL to some extent? Nick said his 
metadata is in xml files rather than database 
tables. Michael said dcl can attach 
files to projects, but it doesn't allow you to place a structure for 
storage into the project. Nick and Michael agreed to work 
together on XML or database table specifications. Nick explained 
What ratmaze will do is chase down all the 
constituant parts of an index and then transform them with an xslt
 using a cgi script written in python, 
and using DOM to manipulate the page as I assemble it - then using 
4Front to transform it. He had chosen 4front over Sablotron 
simply becuase it had a Debian package.","2002-02-03","15"
"356","162","3","Nick explained he wasn't working to any particular
Document Storage model - I'm creating a 
system based on my experiences mostly, not on any document management 
system that currently exists. I should probably look at those. 
With this new idea to unify docustore and ratmaze I have a little 
to think about. He had an oldish 

proposal, pre-ratmaze and also some very old DTDs for the 
XML data, but If I want to merge all of this 
into one metadata management system, then I'll have to come up with 
some new stuff.","2002-02-03","15"
"357","162","4","Later, he explained the docustore platform 
is more of a database engine for document management than a direct 
document management system.. something like phpgroupware or dcl or geas
or whatever would call upon it for document storage needs. They
would use GNU-RPC to communicate with the document store, which 
would enable them to use any supported RPC mechanism, not just 
CORBA. He said he hadn't progressed very far with his docustore 
ideas yet, but I'm good at doing things that 
theres cohesive demand for. The thread degenerated into a 
competition to see who could be the most demanding.","2002-02-03","15"

The next day, Stuart Bain (stbain) wondered 
now that I know python - how can I help?.

n tier doesnt play nicely yet - and applications arent 'shrinkwrapped'

interested in applications than tools,

considered an imaging interface go go w/ that? That way you can have a 
document imaging and management architecture under one roof. 
Nick said he had envisioned having any 'object'
able to be managed under the same storegae system. OCR would just
be another input method.. 
Stuart said many Document Management systems he had seen were 
for HR departments - 
they are simply document repositories for the immense amount 
of paperwork companies have to process to keep up w/ their hundreds 
of employees - if they want to look up my docs, they punch in my SSN 
and scroll through the descriptions - they would love to 
have it integrated right into their ERP software but this was 
rarely possible as at time of writing. Nick said 
Its pretty trivial, really. the key is making it 
abstract. James noted you might be 
able to use a fair amout of common for database and RPC 
abstraction. Nick said this has been 
recommended to me - particlularly database abstraction stuff.

the start of a trigger system - and lots of other little things

gpl covers redistribution and inhouse solutions 
typically aren't redistributed. There would be no advantedge to 
using the GNU Public License (GPL) if its an

unfortunately, aside from our samples/

button, only the activated submit button is successful."" Which I 
think means only its values are submitted, so you can know which was 
clicked. Give me a second and I'll actually try it. Michael 
agreed, but said if you need to change form

Javascript.","2002-02-05","15"

Although not working, lynx is not too bad

[tb_save.png]-Submit [tb_new.png]-Submit ... so at least 
you had some idea of what was happening. Scott suggested putting in 
alt="""" attributes for the images 
to improve this, which would also 
give tooltip hints on graphical browsers.
However, Jan expected that lynx doesnt 
like to send x,y arguments for an image he cannot display...... so if 
you can click on the image in lynx it wouldn't work. Scott 
confirmed by testing that lynx is giving me .x 
and .y values of 0 on image submit.","2002-02-05","15"

pretty misleading. why I just go to the official W3 specs?

didnt use it. But looking on the HTML 4.0 spec. ... GREAT. I ve never 
heard about LABELS in forms etc.. Scott agreed, but noted

beginning I had planned to make just the actual row in the actual

minimizing the number of times you have to submit/wait for the server 
to respond would be good - so from that perspective, the way you have 
it now is much better. Jan agreed, but asked about cursors - 
Without cursor, how do I know which row to 
delete (if i don't use javascript)? Scott thought 
how you have it now is probably the best you 
can do. No way you can know that w/o JS, so it'll always be a bit 
confusing to newbies. I like the way you highlight the deleted row in 
red. Actually, you could have a seperate delete button for each 
row. but that would require a change to the form definition.

make it so it doesn't require any (or very little) rewriting to work 
under GNUE - I do fully intend to have it stand-alone in any case

and ponder dependencies and templates etc. Nick said he had 
thought DCL was project management and issue 
tracking. Derek said it was it was 
initially a work order system - then it had help desk kind of added

doesn't provide gross payroll calculations, general ledger 
cross-referencing and said Looks

i see payroll as a module, time keeping as 
a module, etc etc. I think of dcl in some ways as cost based time 
keeping that would feed time into payroll - or into a traditional time 
keeping system. He personally now used DCL to log everything he

a report from dcl would tell me the same

"376","168","4","Andrew said his system, called KOMP, would handle 
inputs/outputs from clients and front-ends 
to MRP/ERP systems - all in real-time fashion, along with p2p support 
so that the timeclocks themselves can be 90% turnkey and scale up with 
the business - of course small businesses don't need all of the ERP 
features. It could be a complement 
to DCL, in support of real-time tracking, ie shop floors, 
although it was more for blue-collar work 
tracking than white. Jason Cater (jcater) agreed - 
dcl is great, but only for a minority of 
time-tracking tasks - I wouldn't keep up w/my hourly ppl's pay w/it :)

Baumann (chillywilly) wasn't keen on lyx, for reasons discussed in

Andrew said he would use Dia for diagrams. He 
was thinking of using SOAP (or XML-RPC) to 
handle the client front-end (read: from the shop floor) to KOMP.
Daniel commented that we are building an 
rpc abstarction that will support xml-rpc, soap, corba, etc. - 
which our tools will use as a common API. Andrew was 
worried wouldn't that be a little heavy 
between the shop floor and KOMP? as 
the shop floor will have timeclocks 
(PC-based) which punches and labor start/stop will be recorded. The 
timeclocks would then query/message the KOMP engine. Daniel 
said appreciated Andrew's concerns, but 
I don't think it will slow anything down - you have a config file 
ststing which mechanism you are going to use - it loads the 
""plugin"" - then can send that type of message - similar to 
the db plugins. Andrew said 
Right, KOMP itself will be abstracted away from the external interface. 
There would be a module between the shop floor and KOMP.

GNUe is 2 years old believe it or not

could say more about the ""history
"" of GNUe - reinhard was also there in the beginning. 
GNUe was different from other free software or 'open source' ERP 
projects like OpenEAS or 
Compiere, as it was not just 
applications, but a framework that can 
be extended to write any sort of enterprise application.
He added once the GNUe tools marture to a

Peter Sullivan (psu), remembering

suggested it;s the unicode bug again by the
looks of it. Derek agreed we had 
this before (on this machine) and i dont recall if it never got fixed

it's saving your file as unicode once again, how'd you do that?????
. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
if there's a will masta will find the way

such a buggy tester and said he 
doesnt feel appreciated ;). Later, he reported 
i think my unicode issue went away - 
twice i have gotten new cvs from designer and it just acts WILD - 
so i delete my cvs dir and re co and all is well.","2002-02-09","16"

The next day, Derek asked 
do you have any idea if the unicode issue is 
in our code or my beta python version? 
as i really dont want to spend all night upgrading python
from source if that wouldn't fix it. 
He asked 
can you tell me which .py file in designer does the save?
so i can start 'debugging' the problem - or tell me what to grep for
. James said 
GObj should do the save - dumpXML 
Derek said 
if i save blank form it works - 
if i save hand created form it works - 
if i save a form after i run the wizard it does unicode.
Based on this inconsistant behaviour, he thought 
its something that wizard 
creates but not the wizard itself. James asked 
Derek to run a sample form and cut and paste the error message 
for him. Derek noted that the xmlDump function was producing 
the correct output, 
so im wondering where perhaps its happening in writing 
out the file or someting?. He asked 
what is StringIO(), 
which the save routines were using. James said this might be 
relevant, as its unicode aware
. Derek tracked down the code that did the save 
routines, and said it 
looks pretty standard to me. James said that 
stringIO can't mix and match 7bit and 
8bit codes. He added 
IIRC weren't there some I18N changes made so that 
someone could do forms in lang other than english?
Derek bypassed the normal save routines and had xmlDump 
write directly to a file, and was still getting the problem.","2002-02-09","16"

running?. Derek said he was using 0.6.5. Jason 
wonders if 0.6.5 is not compatable w/2.2

been called 3.0 considering all the changes
. Derek said he would 
try a newer pyxml, but this 
didnt fix things. He was beginning to think the problem 
was probably probably python2.2a
- but i really wish that had better proof of that. 
He said what is bothering me about this 
problem was how inconsistant it was. 
Jason asked does anyone else use python2.2?
as I'm not kidding... a lot changed in 2.2. James said
IIRC unicode support was big in 
2.2.","2002-02-09","16"
"387","172","5","Derek found a reference from the official python page that 
said In Python 2.1, the StringIO module 
(though not cStringIO) supported Unicode. This capability is 
accidentally not present in Python 2.2. This 
explains why SECOND time it happens
- is stringio is used to READ the xml file. 
James and Jason both swore loudly. Derek said that 
i can use 'emacs' to fix things for now - 
but this is big as we need to not tell people to use 2.2 or we need to
fix our code to not use stringio. Jason said he would patch 
the Designer code to work around this, but Derek thought it might be 
better to say we dont work well with 2.2 
until they fix bug. Jason uploaded the patch to CVS, but 
wasn't sure it would work - if the same issue
then we are 2.2 incompatable for the indeterminable future. 
Derek said thats probably not too horrid 
as im the only one insane enough to run 2.2 :) Jason hoped 
I hope they come out w/2.2.1 before major 
distro's bump up to 2.2.x support. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly)

that Java has something similar.  Other than gnue, is there anything

programs other than the forms builder? For example, can I use corba to

if he wants database abstraction for C code he might be better off 
right now today to look at libGDA - as writing bindings for our 
gnue-common is probably more trouble than he is looking for. 
If he is looking to use application server then yes via corba today he 
could use our app server with his front end and write methods in 
python or C. If he is looking to us gfd, he could write a forms engine 
in C though i wouldnt recommend it at this stage of the game.

designer, reports (limited). Andrew said 
There's a benefit of having GNUe available

right now it's forms only but

when dealing w/ objects internally i see

a. a framework for rapid business application development
b. a prebuilt system using the framework that is highly extensible

multi tier (application server).","2002-02-10","16"

we do have a lot of supply chain and some
accounting with specificaitions (read business requirements) - HOWEVER
those specs were built with our application server in mind.

gnue success stories - and we want them bad - which means im sure you 
would get more than one of us to help you on practice management 
software IF you were willing to give them back to gnue for others

this is a new business and all of us are in agreement that GNU is the

NOTHING at all currently other than paper you could give them USEFUL

maximum flexibility - and it works liek a SERVER i.e. i can run in 
server mode so that you can 'cache' reports like monthly financials

one VERY useful thing it does is document merges :) which is VERY 
important for practice management as they have to write lots of

your objects in geas and map your relational tables to them or 
somethng similar. James said 
i do relational - the form can do master/detail but designer can't 
auto set it up - what I do is make forms for each table, put the 
blocks together and hand modify the datasource entries.

liked python or didn't object to it. Andrew said he had
been deliberating between Python and Java. 
I had already concluded that perl, while being very veristale (sp), 
would get too spaghettiy in large projects - what cinched is was 
Jython heh; the fact that I could run Python code on top of java 
machines cinched Python as the winner. James said he 
dislikes java with a passion. 
He said a major problem with java is the 
inconsistancies in the java VM, meaning you often had to use 
specific versions of browsers for specific applications. Sometimes 
you ended up redoing the systems to run 
java on the web server using jsp 
which makes the whole cross platform benefit of java kinda moot
. However, he hadn't used Java recently. He concluded 
I used to be able to get GCC to run on far 
more platforms that a JVM - which I always found somewhat amusing :)

if i want it in the framework (on EVERY form) it shoudl go 
in gnue/etc - if i want it on only SOME forms it should be

replace standard menu options with bespoke ones -

developers to specify a location within the existing 
menu structure to attatch a new menu item to. Derek 
disagreed, saying 
i dont think menu structures belong in forms - he 
still preferred doing this in the gpd file. 
James said it's like a custom 
menu for an app, whereas 
gpd is the basis of workflow. Derek said that was 
part of it, but its made to do 
what you are saying - it can call outside apps, reports, 
other forms etc etc. James said all he wanted to do

defined in this one form. Derek said that James'

levies to be treated like crap - so the higher the price tag and 
more shit you are treated more likely you are to come in search 
of FS. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
well, it's no secret that IT budgets have been slashed, yet the 
technological needs have not shrunken at all. He said 
it trips me out the consultants who we 
bring in who think the products they supply should be supplied 
at a cost relative to the about of money we save over the long 
run - instead of how much the product is actually worth.
Derek thought it might be interesting if, say, toilet paper was
priced that way - lets face it you 
would be buying a lot more underwear without it.","2002-02-13","16"
"419","189","2","However, toilet paper is bad example 
as its really not REUSABLE. A better example 
woudl be a tooth brush - 
as brushing your teeth saves on average 
2 cavities a year - and cavities cost 800 to fill - so 200 for a 
brush that saves you 1600 is an INCREDIBLE deal. Then the 500 for 
the toothpaste contract - thats where the REAL value is - i mean 
for 700 you will have your money back in less than 6 mos - how 
incredible is that? He noted 
what is funny is anyone reading this would probably die laughing
- but this is common thing in IT industry. 
Of course, the vendor just makes sure 
his toothpaste is incompatiable with other vendors brushes
so you are locked into that toothpaste contract - or forced to 
buy a new brush. Jason said that 
their toothbrushes require their own special ""holder"" - 
custom installed, of course. You can't reuse your existing holders 
(""I know the slots are the same size; but ours it calibrated 
especially for our toothbrushes.  Also, who's to say your holder can 
withstand the extra load""). Derek added 
yeah crest's holders just dont 'scale' 
well - i mean a family of 5 or 6 and your screwed.","2002-02-13","16"
"420","189","3","Jason said let's not forget ""user 
training"". and floss,
added Derek, thats high performance dental 
care - you pay top dollar for floss. Jason said 
one member of the family will need to be 
flown to our ""flossing seminar"" - BUT it's in Miami this year
. Derek said for only 4,500 i can 
get crest 'reach' toothbrush certified - with that cert i am like 80% 
less likely to have ginvitis which is a huge value - peridontial disease
 is SO costly. He noted that the 
toothbrush vendor regularly is able to sell brush, paste and floss to 
folks with dentures :). Jason suggested that maybe 
the vendor has a 20% stake in the Denture 
company - ""to spread his risk"".","2002-02-13","16"
"421","189","4","Derek thought he should perhaps 
make a small list of things that are 'cheap' but highly useful - 
then see if they have some 'money saving' value like the toothbrush -
""what if the rest of the world operated like a software 
company..."" we ahvent even relaly touched on the 'monoply' 
implications here :) just on the no value ones :). 
He said people wouldnt buy a 200 dollar 
tooth brush and a 500 toothpaste contract - they will buy millions 
of dollars in software license fees - though i think slowly people are 
stopping the trend - whether it be because of reduced budgets or 
waking up and smelling the coffee.","2002-02-13","16"

btw, I was looking at some code 
in common and was wondering what GObj is exactly?.
Jason Cater (jcater) said it was 
just a generic object that can be expressed as XML.
He explained there's a few other 
convenience functions in there but otherwise it was 
just a container for items like GFForm, GFBlock, GFEntry 
and GFBox.","2002-02-13","16"
"423","190","2","Daniel asked whether it would 
be useful if all business objects on the app serverwere GObjs?
. Jason said he hadn't considered that. Daniel said this 
would mean you could transparently 
get persistence of GObjs ;P. Jason said 
well, the only persistance I see us 
needing is storing the objects in their corresponding XML file
- so the point of GObj is already to provide transparent 
persistence via xml, but he wasn't sure. Daniel 
clarified so, does having GObjs 
witht he ability to output xml help you generate forms? 
Is that how you use it?. Jason confirmed this. 
Daniel said maybe I should 
concentrate on an ODMG python binding to store any type of 
python object [...] anyway, GObj just kinda caught my eye - 
think about it, lemme know if anything smacks you upside 
the head ;). Jason 
nervously looks for approaching trout.","2002-02-13","16"
"424","191","1","James Thompson (jamest) asked 
navigator - how official is it?. He wanted
to make win setup.exe of it
. Jason Cater (jcater) said he thought it was very
useful, but wonders if he shouldn't 
add a ""tree-style"" interface first. 
James suggested 
you might be able to rip the event handler (unused) in forms UIwxpython
to possibly grab those events you're missing in UIwxweb.
He would have to prioritise getting 
windows support polished up tonight in there and try to 
work out why the CVS version of Forms was not working on 
Windows. Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) confirmed that he 
regarded Navigator as 'official' even though it needed more 
things adding and hadn't been part of a release yet.","2002-02-13","16"
"425","192","1","Jan Ischebeck (jan) said he had been working on block support, 
but the biggest problem, i've spared up 
;) for later: master-detail relationship. James Thompson
(jamest) wished you could interface to 
our python stuff in the normal GNUe Forms client. He 
haven't seen a php/python bridge though :(
. Jan suggested We could do it by 
SOAP. [...] I'm not shure how to write the python part, but if there 
would be a gnue-common webservice, possibly with a similar interface 
like GEAS..... James said 
there was work done on gnue-rpc, but Jason Cater had had to 
deal with more pressing issues. Jason (jcater) said 
the real issue is that gcommon is a library, 
not necessarily a service - so I'm not sure how that would work - 
it's as easy to do XML-RPC in Python as in PHP, though. 
Jan said he would particularly like access to
the db abstraction layer in 
GNUe Common.","2002-02-13","16"
"426","192","2","James said he was thinking of adding to Forms 
the ability to say that forms pages are 
steps - so that I could rapidly design a web form that is one or more 
steps - then on the last page a commit is done - as personally I 
hate making html forms. Jan said that was 
possible - Whats about a ""WIZARD""
attribut in the <form..> tag?. James said he had not 
given this a lot of thought, and 
i'm not sure how the normal client would deal with this type of form
 or even if it was desirable functionality. It wouldn't be a 
problem if it required a change to the XML definitions, as 
I don't think the DTD is stable 
yet.","2002-02-13","16"
"427","192","3","Jan said the PHP forms client was very slow at the moment, 
as Every time php parses the xml file and 
load session data., but was faster if cached. 
He would look at improving the caching once 
the basic features are in.","2002-02-13","16"
"428","192","4","Jan started to think about James' wizard idea, and said 
every page needs back and forth 
buttons and the last one needs the commit button.. 
James explained how to do this in python. He said the wizard 
would be usefull in 2 places - 
html forms are #1. They could also be useful for 
situations like say you want your 
reps to always ask the same things in a specific order. 
Jason Cater (jcater) noted if we had 
multipage blocks this would be easy to do using existing 
""pages"" concepts. Jan thought that however 
the wizard worked, it needed to work for 
the standart client as well, and wondered 
Whats about using the 
normal pages and some triggers to implement it?.
James said that 
right now forms are of type=""tabbed"" iirc which makes the pages 
become notebook tabs - a 
type=""stepthru"" could be added. It was important to
hide all the extras - 
query, print, next/prev foo, jump to record so that there 
was only one route through the wizard with 
and gave a next, back, cancel button. Multiple blocks wouldn't 
do this. Jason agreed, but said 
multipage blocks are probably a prerequisite - and if you had multipage 
blocks, you could easily simulate such a system without a special tag
.","2002-02-13","16"
"429","192","5","Later, Jan asked 
why shouldn't two blocks share on datasource?. James said
our datasources implement master/detail - 
so they have a concept of current record. This allowed 
users to cruse thru a master/detail 
set of data changing masters and children at will - then commit 
the whole mess. Jason said this was a key feature - 
I don't know of another forms implementation 
that can do master/detail like GNUe can. Jan did a 
simple master detail implementation 
in one single block and decided . 
Ok, thats enough master detail for tonight. :).","2002-02-13","16"
"430","192","6","James said that he had now put Jan's PHP Forms client 
on the GNUe 
website - i set him up an 
account so we can always show this stuff off :). 
He had already publicised it to several contacts by e-mail. 
He tried Jan's 'pre-alpha' wizard. Jan noted 
only thing is form cannot send mail
to you. James suggested using triggers, but Jason 
thought conceptually, it wouldn't be 
a problem to have a ""write-only"" database driver that 
actually sends an email :). Jan said his PHP client 
needed some more debugging, and currently didn't support
RPC, SOAP, orbit,.... just 
postgres...... However, James said he thought it was 
really useful, especially as the same GNUe Forms Definitions 
(.gfd) could be used with the normal Forms client. Jan 
added e-mail forwarding as well.","2002-02-13","16"
"431","192","7","James was very enthusisatic, but emphasised 
the need to be carefull
and figure out how to wrap this into common and the 
main Forms client as well. 
we need to get php and python playing together, so 
they could feed some of Jan's work on the PHP client back 
into the main Forms client. Jason said that, 
if we don't mind restricting this to 
apache for the near future we might want to look at mod_python 
or mod_snake. He cut-and-pasted 
Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter 
within the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in 
Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have 
access to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections 
and other data between hits and access to Apache internals..
James thought this sounded promising.","2002-02-13","16"
"432","192","8","Later, James emphasised that they were trying to merge 
Jan's work into the core product, 
so that the python forms core and common can be used.
Derek Neighbors (derek) wondered whether a PHP Forms client was 
worth it - in the same amount of time
he could probably learn one of the python embeded deals, but 
he admitted he wasn't keen on web-based forms generally. James said 
the whole focus was ways to reuse what 
we have, and the lessons learned could be useful in 
developing an HTML forms client. He thought 
what was demo'd tonight was nothing short of 
breathtaking.","2002-02-13","16"
"433","193","1","James Thompson (jamest) said 
one of my users had forms generate the following error msg - 
Bad! Bad! Bad!. He thought he 
may need to clean up the error

glimpseindexing the source - to see where that msg is embedded.
It is probably worth the time to make sure all our output is 
politically correct [...] I could just see someone calling me 
up - um this forms says I'm screwed - what do you
 mean? - well the error message is ""You're 
Screwed!"" - oh that......um.....it's a

issue is we will break our debian support :(. Derek Neighbors 
(derek) asked what is there that needs 
to break? He felt that keeping Debian GNU/Linux support was 
more important. James said the urge to

James was keen, as he 
would love to see mac os screen shots :). 
Theoretically, the main setup.py file should do everything 
for a developer install
that included everything. User installs were slightly more 
complicated, as they had to run a setup.py for each part of 
the application they wanted. This installed the programs, 
and then Neil had to add their working directory to his 
path, but then got the introduction form working straight 
away. Designer also worked first time, with a few minor 
GUI issues. James then suggested adding details of a valid

Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) explained this was

 David asked if this was the stable distribution. Daniel said
HEAD is usually the most unstable as it is
like the current cvs version. Derek Neighbors (derek) explained
generally branches are stable of some 
sort. Daniel said Usually you hack
on a certain stable branch and fix bugs - HEAD has all the 
'development' stuff in it - at some point HEAD becomes stable and you 
branch off again (that's one way to do it). You can merge bug fixes 
form the stable branch back into HEAD. The cvs book is a good source
.","2002-02-18","17"
"442","198","2","David said this seems counterintuitive
to me; i'd think the stable should be default ;). Daniel 
pointed out well you usually only checkout 
cvs code if you're going to hack (theoretically) - normal users
would just download an official release. However, 
some ppl do keep HEAD 'stable' and start 
an unstable 'branch' - you can do it however you want. GNUe

the 'diffs' - so once you do the initial checkout usually you're not 
downloading a lot after that - it just pacthes the files and grabs new

so, in essence it is incremental, but it is all ASCII of course for

you were willing to work on the application

explained that for Application Server, 
we have something written in C that had some lofty goals and works 
to a degree. Rather than give you the spec for that we have been 
debating about what we really want in an app server and 
whether its smarter to 'phase' in functionality.","2002-02-18","17"

an application server were..... (iirc) a. provide n-tier architecture, 
where db server could be independent of middleware and middleware 
independent of client and at either tier you could do fail over/
load balancing or replication - b. that storage would be in SQL 
database but presented as 'objects' for client applications - 
c. that the objects methods could be written in any language - 
d. some other goals that i dont recall w/o looking at the docs

"447","200","3","Steve noted multiple languages and 
transports is a desirable objective, but it comes at a cost.. 
Derek agreed, but said 
we are hoping in many ways maintenance will be better or at least 
suits will think so, as you wouldn't have to re-train 
in-house programmers to use a particular language to use or 
extend GNUe - they could even use Visual Basic if they wanted to. 
Abstracting the transport layer was important 
because if anything transport is in a 
state of flux - 2 years ago it was DCOM, last year it was CORBA, six 
months ago it was XML-RPC, with .net its now SOAP. Abstracting that 
lets us kind of 'roll' with the flow with minimum effort and allows 
maximum types of clients to use the server. He admitted he 
personally didn't consider language abstraction as important, as 
im a python freak -  so i woudl be fine 
with it only supporting python :). Jason Cater (jcater) pointed 
out we do try to design our APIs with this 
abstraction in mind; not simply try to mold some existing product to 
fix our needs after the fact - of course, that only takes you so far 
:). Steve worried that you 
need to be experts in all supported areas just to defend yourself and 
provide decent service.. Derek felt 
i think this is where open source kicks 
butt - generally what we do is implement our FAVORITE way of doing 
things but leave an open api for others - then as the 'expert' in that 
way comes along they just plug into the API. Like database abstraction 
- we did two or three providerswe use regularly and one day code just 
'showed up from ibm' for db2 out of the blue.","2002-02-18","17"

Python as the glue, with C handling the performance-intensive portions.

actually working? or lets put it this way: is anybody using it in production?
 James said as for forms and designer they 
are usable today - they are also used in production. He confirmed GNUe 
used XML for forms definitions - they were using 
pyxml - with our own custom wrapper parser.","2002-02-21","18"
"453","201","3","Jijo asked which was the best module to start with 
if I want to get a feel of the code? James said that
On the python side of the fence, gnue-common is the
core of forms, designer, navigator, and reports. It provides a lot of the core
functionality of these tools - a dictionary based xml parser that maps to GObj
(our base python object) trees, a data engine that has drivers for every python db
api 2.0 available (we'll also support non-db api 2.0 drivers), a app framework that
embeds a debug system, config system, profiling system, and so on. 
He explained forms is our user interface system - 
designer currenly writes only form xml files - however its capable of handling any
xml format defined in our GParser format. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
said that geas is in a state where it basically works
(more or less) but the code has become unmaintainable and we are in the process of
rewriting part by part - so if you are a ""developer"" we would greatly
appreciate help in doing this as it's hard and time consuming work - if you are a
""user"" you'd better keep your hands off geas for the time being
:) James continued Navigator is currently a
brain dead navigation system - its a quick hack based upon common that lets you
define processes - these processes define steps that run forms, or apps - some day
this will support role based access control but not today :)  Reports can generate
reports :) - but is not complete - it can be used however -  it's author used it to
generate something like a 10,000 letter mailing to their customer base
IIRC.","2002-02-21","18"

"460","203","2","Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he would do some Debian packages - 
I just need to get a working copy of GnuE on my system 
so that I can make sure I don't break anything. Derek said that 
to make a debian shouldnt require changing the 
source code of a program (or so i would think). Jeff said 
It depends on if any locations are hardcoded.  Some of
Debian's filesystem rules are a little twisted. Derek said this shouldn't 
be a problem. He was keen to get working debs in the
pool by sunday night for 'political' reasons. He asked 
do you know how to get the source that made those
debs? i.e. if apt-get source gnue-forms works and gets the files necessary to 
actually create the .deb file we are 90% done - all we have to do is find out WHAT
is breaking when you apt-get install gnue-forms for example and fix that. 
Daniel did a quick apt-get and reported looks like it
installs for me home billy. Derek said it may
INSTALL - does it WORK? He said we have 
gotten NUMEROUS reports that it doesnt 'work' -  however we DID have people file 
bugs in debian. Jeff said there was nothing shown in the Debian bug 
tracking system. He said Your reason for not being in 
woody so far is that you're not building on all the arch's. That should be trivial
to fix. Jason Cater (jcater) wondered why - 
could it be a dependency that doesn't build that's keeping us back?. 
Jeff confirmed that, although he wasn't the package maintainer, he had access to 
maintain them as a NMU - Non-maintainer 
upload..","2002-02-21","18"
"461","203","3","Jeff later reported that he got the gnue-forms debian package installed - 
Incidentally, the only install problem I experiences was
a conflict with pyxml - That's a broken python dependancy, not a gnue 
problem. This did not install the demo forms, however. He noted 
Ah, joy.  gnue-forms failed to compile on *every* arch.
That's almost certainly a build-deps problem. Digging further, he noted 
I think that he didn't reazlie that Depends aren't
necessarily filled for build-deps.. He posted a python traceback error 
message he got trying to start Forms with the sample intro.gfd. However, there 
were no Forms experts on hand to take it further.","2002-02-21","18"

what the diff is between an inner and outer join as

an inner join only includes rows 
where BOTH tables are the same - and outer join includes all of 
either the left or right table and only the matching of the other
. Derek gave an example. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested 
come back tomorrow for ""Fun 
with Unions!"". Daniel supposed that SQL 
included any set operations right
- as thats the basis - you have a set with relations, iirc

was that the major GNU/Linux distributions didn't have 2.3 yet. 
Arjen asked shoul wxPython match the 
subversion number too, or just the minor? James said 
i had the best luck matching both

wxpython website only had current versions.","2002-02-24","18"
"466","206","1","Jan Ischebeck (jan_) said that RPC calls involved object reference 
IDs and asked Should there be a 
""description"" of all objects to check against?
Jason Cater (jcater) said we do pass handles 
for object when using transports that don't support objects natively
(i.e., the CORBA driver won't pass around references, but actual 
objects) - the handle is used to reference a proxy object on the 
server-side - so this was meant to be transparent to the client 
and server - at least when using GRPC on both ends. 
Jan said A gprc is not needed to 
comunicate with SOAP or XMLRPC. The only function it can have is to 
be a kind of control. That means to check which parts of an object 
should be available by RPC and which not. He added 
 If i understand it right, corba needs 
an IDL file for client and server. So for corba there is the need of 
an definition of the tranfered classes on both sides, which 
SOAP and XMLRPC didn't. Derek Neighbors interjected 
we are not wanting to define every 
object - merely a wrapper to pass objects back and forth over the 
transport. Jason said 
we very much need the grpc file to know what to expose - 
the client may not need the grpc file but one has to exist.
Jan suggested You mean, the grpc file is 
something like a communication standarization document. Something like
a grammar. i.e. people can SPEAK, without everytime looking on it ;)

grpc is very much in the early planning stage - as in, you saw the 
first round of my thought process (you poor soul :) - and we really 
don't have any docs yet. Jan rephrased his original question
as Should the incoming request be checked 
against the GRPC file by the server?. Jason said 
I hadn't planned on it - but hadn't gotten to
that point. Jan said the basic 
structure you've coded are quite  good. I just had to insert some 
lines to make it working. He would document the discussions 
as a GNURPC pre alpha draft

Jan said its horrible... ... im getting 
more and more addicted ;) He found it much easier to read

it says a lot about python's reablility when jan can figure out grpc 
:) James thought it says alot 
about jan's state of mind in comparison to jcater's state of mind
 and goes and cowers in terror in 
the closet fearing a world where more that one person thinks like 
that. Jan said understanding the 
grpc code was not very difficult. First you have to imagine a donut, 
.... ;). Jason said jan is right... 
all the grpc samples are donut related - so you really DO have to 
think ""donuts"" Derek hoped 
that jan isnt under impression that a 
grpc donut factory will produce EDIBLE donuts :) - he could 
imagine some interesting help desk calls. Jan said that he had put 
a sample GNU-RPC donut installation on the web. Jason got all

highlighted the current field being edited....would this be a bad 
thing? He said my users are 
complaining about finding the cursor. Possible solutions 
were block cursor - highlighting - 
bolding current fields text - enlarging current field a small amount
. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested 
changing background color of current field to a pale yellow???
- ala my label editor in designer. James was worried that 
color blind people might not notice it
. He suggested we can make the 
highlighting an option in gnue.conf - highlighting=none, colored, 
bold, foo and so on. Derek supported this, and suggested 
i think the 'proper' way to denote 
field of focus is to bold highlight the border of the field with 
focus - this way text or background isnt 'altered' which can be 
hard on eyes - but the field appears 'elevated' to distinguish it
 Jason said I think we can't do 
that in wx - or that would've been our primary approach :(.

gnue.conf is great - so when you have pyGTK and pyQT working someday
you can make it right easy :).","2002-02-27","18"
"470","208","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested starting with the lessons 
learned from the existing GNUe Application Server (GEAS), 
then defining the goals and direction of a new GEAS. 
He said GEAS had 
evolved w/o direction - meaning it was something treshna designed 
for specific own needs without a direct definition of what it was to be
. James Thompson (jamest) said GEAS had lacked 
forms support, security, 
performance, stability. This last point was much 
better than it had been, and was now mainly due to problems 
in his area anyway. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said when GEAS had 
been originally written, it lacked 
coordination, goal, interest from 
other team members (including himself). Derek agreed, 
but said that this had been partly recognised, and that 
the gnue version of geas 
was significantly different to the one Treshna wrote for 
themselves.","2002-02-28","19"
"471","208","2","Reinhard defined the overall goal of GEAS - 
to pull the application logic
 (or 'business rules' out of both the Forms and the 
database backend. James noted that 
triggers and the like wouldn't be removed from forms - 
but in an OO setting they wouldn't be used. Jan 
Ischebeck (Jan) agreed 
2- tier is also important. Derek confirmed
forms in 2 tier mode is kind 
of necessary to hit our larger goal, but he and 
Reinhard wanted to focus on GEAS for the current discussion.","2002-02-28","19"
"472","208","3","Derek and Reinhard suggested some other goals for GEAS.
Derek said that abstraction/independance of database, RPC 
and language were important - as otherwise 
i can use jboss right now today 
. Reinhard said he personally didn't care much 
about these issues, except database independance. Derek said
RPC abstraction was important to keep up to date - 
CORBA is dead - every body right 
now is using XML-RPC - but what will it be next month? 
SOAP??? M$ FOO TRANSPORT?. Reinhard suggested GNUe 
should seriously consider just using jboss instead of writing 
their own Application Server if this was all they were hoping to 
gain. Derek said the main issues he had 
with using jboss were 
a. its not a gnu project (one goal of GNU is to have a full 
suite of GNU apps) - b. its java (as are mostly ALL of the 
free app servers) and the thought of method code in java hurts 
me.","2002-02-28","19"
"473","208","4","Jan re-iterated Reinhard's point of being able 
to define business rules, methods 
and data without having to be a software expert. 
Derek agreed, but didn't want to 
get into own defined macro language syntax. He re-pasted 
the list of goals, which were now up to 5. Reinhard added a few 
more, and said he still didn't agree with Derek's points about RPC 
and language independance. Derek said security and stablity were 
important, but so was usability. He said 
you need not be a hacker to maintain 
or use the softwaer -  BUT i dont expect home users to be able to do 
so - more a business analyst type person. Reinhard said
i don't think it's maintainable to have 
20 dbdrivers for 13 db backends. James said 
i think we hit a good mix in common....
meaning basic support is there and the framework is 
maintainable.","2002-02-28","19"
"474","208","5","Derek asked about 
object transparency - at the moment, the goals 
did not include this, which was how other free software 
Application Servers did it. It was noted that 'not Java' sounded 
a bit negative, so Derek suggested combining this with the 
licensing issue to say 1. Must be 
GPL and built with truly free tools. Jan said the 
possibility to change 
buissness objects without breaking old code was an 
important goal. Reinhard agreed, and thought that was implied 
by the goal to be easy to 
configure and adaptable without downtime. James said 
i don't think any app server today 
does that.","2002-02-28","19"

different priorities on some of the goals, but felt he should

Neil said we need a central repository 
for defining the business objects (or what ever you want 
to call them) - So that business functionality can be defined 
in one place and show up in all the places it needs to in the

you don't really expect suits to design business objects do you?

there is something in between a luser and a hurd hacker ;) 
He said it's about freedom - 
the user should be free to adapt the software to their needs 
(freedom 1 IIRC).","2002-02-28","19"
"478","208","9","Jan asked about an implementation 
plan? Reinhard suggested 
a. we implement in python for the time being - 
b. we implement something that fulfills 1-5 and 7 and 
make the architecture so that the other goals can be reached 
afterwards - while we simultanously implement the 
""object designer"" and therefore fulfils 6 and 8.
He suggested 
merge 6 and 8 into - must be configurable dynamically, centrally, 
w/o programming skills, without downtime, and in seperate 
""layers"" for various levels of specialization. 
James supported the use of python, with bottlenecks 
recoded in C/C++ if they couldn't be 
fixed via code cleanup or re-design. This was 
why i like python approach so much - 
it's lends itself to readability and it's highly productive.
Daniel said doesn't make you design 
better software though ;) - no language can. Jason Cater

reusing GTriggerNSObject (or something like that)

Reinhard said please let's not 
discuss coding details. James agreed, but said 
i guess my point is - 
I think a huge part of a python based geas resides in 
common today. Reinhard said

think - that way, reports would use the same ""driver"" -  
as would integrator, etc. Daniel asked

Daniel said there's a relationship 
attribute in the ODMG Object Model. He said 
all objects are relational, but they also 
have behavior. James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
is that to handle the cases  where OO 
design can't cut it?, running as he went. Daniel pointed out 
you guys use python for cying out loud - 
from now on you have to code using only lambda ;). Jason said 
we're all for OO programming, but the data 
backend doesn't have to be oo - /me thinks of all his business data -

you only have to think in objects - one

It was another example of abstraction, such as the
rpc absatraction that Jason was 
working on, or the db drivers 
abstracted in GNUe Common. He 
wonders why people just do not see the power in modularity.
James said i feel we do that because so 
many free projects solve a very limited role - you can get a ui tool 
for mysql or postgresql or oracle -  but having one tool that works 
with them all would IMHO be better. Derek Neighbors (derek) 
pointed out that designer is mostly made 
up of reused forms code :) -  and if you look at the db drivers i

Daniel said GEAS would have an object data 
management system - which includes OODBMS, object-rerlational mapping, 
etc.. Other than tactical coding issues, the main strategic 
problem with the old GEAS was that there was no Object design in it -

would we reuse gcd format and its parser or do a new or modified format - 
originally i hated the idea but more an more i like idea of XML definition
as it would make using designer a SNAP for creating objects and doing 
objects in UML in dia is only an XSLT style sheet away from pumping to 
an XML format. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
i see 3 possibilities for storing object 
definitions - 1. store it in .gcd and .py - 2. store it in .xml - 
3. store it in database. Derek said 
i see database as same as xml, i.e. 
you could store the data in a database and pull into xml stream 
on the fly - so that the engine always uses xml. 
Reinhard said he would prefer to store object definitions in a database. 
Derek said the big thing about making 
them in db is it becomes a BITCH to edit them w/o a 'tool' and 
database access. Reinhard said 
what really convinced me for database is it's the only possibility 
imho to get dynamic updates being accepted in realtime. 
Derek felt that using XML could support this too. Reinhard asked 
how would geas know that a xml file 
has changed? or would geas rescan all xml files for every 
operation? Derek said users would test changes in a
test GEAS first, then migrate them to the live server, either
real-time or at a designated time. He felt

objects mid stream on somethings - as it toast transactions 
in progress.","2002-02-02","19"

detail - and as long as it's transparent to the user it should 
be up to the one who implements it. Jason agreed - 
it fits in with our model of providing options
and not forcing people to do what we think is best.

Application Server (GEAS) would have. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 	
it should have little direct impact on 
two tier. On compatibility with the old 
GEAS, Derek said we are discussing 
modifying the gcd specification some - if we do that then you will 
probably have some issues. He said 
if your time frame isnt immediate you could wait until the first 
prototypes of GEAS(v2) start showing up - we dont have a large 
production geas base, so there have really to date been no concerns 
about backwards compatiablity.","2002-02-06","19"
"498","217","1","Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked is that 
naming convention for packages, modules in geas you did with neilt 
still making sense ? Reinhard said 
i think yes - because it's about how the 
packages, modules and classes can be translated into table and column 
names. Dmitry asked where it was documented. Reinhard said 
i think it should be somewhere in the 
mailing list archives - probably in the old gnue-geas@lists.gnue.org 
archives - plus i think it's in the module writer's guide 
- but not sure. It's also 
'documented' (in a sense) in

Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked are they broken 
again? - the bugs that I had filed god closed. Derek said 
i think common is busted - as designer 
cant find some images - and the .conf file doesnt get created only the 
sample. Nick asked are they based on 
a release or CVS?. Derek wasn't sure - 
eventually i would like to see - 
gnue-forms, gnue-appsever, gnue-designer, gnue-common - then a tasksel 
for gnue, and eventually seperate versions of common for each 
database backend, just like apache does 
with its 'modules'. It would be interesting to have 'dev' 
packages for the CVS versions as well - Nick said 
-cvs is the normal suffix for cvs 
stuff. Derek said for now just 
release no other frills is cool by me :).","2002-03-07","20"

,  
Nick Rusnov (nickr) provided Stuart Bain (stbain) with 

a link to his document store proposals. He said 
the storage part is pretty simple - the 
library will be the fun part.. Stuart said the 
indexing, sorting, searching would be 
the difficult part. Nick said it would use 
GnUe Common - I believe that it provides DB 
neutrality. The front end would be through 
forms/web/whatever - all the various objects 
are RPC and 'trustless' or reduced trust relationships - so your client
just has to speak RPC. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) confirmed 
that Common would provide datanbase and RPC abstraction, but said 
currently only good docs for common are 
the source :( - we do plan on changing that though.","2002-03-08","20"
"501","220","1","It was asked whether GNUe was usable as at time of writing to 
manage a small business. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
gnue is two projects in one - a. create 
the tools that can be used to build powerful business applications -
b. create the powerful business applications themselves. Derek 
Neighbors (dneighbo) added c. a meta 
package of GNU that bundles enterprise software for the GNU project 
:). Reinhard said if you are 
looking at a tool that lets you build your own business apps - then 
you could use gnue for sure. Derek said 
if you are wanting to open the box and 
press the button to have accounting then nope :) - however, 
DCL and Bayonne are both available and 
working.","2002-03-11","20"
"502","220","2","It was asked how much development would be needed to get something 
usable. Derek said this depends - for 
example i expect DCL to be ready very soon for small business (SERVICE) 
based consultants. He explained DCL was 
like a project management / help desk 
system - we are adding strong CRM support into it - and making it so 
that the work order side could be used to generate invoices i.e. a time 
entry/crm/billing solution for software consultants (or any service based 
company) - it is quite usable today. However, he confirmed 
that there is no way to do accounting, and was not expected soon.","2002-03-11","20"

doing it in GNUe shouldnt be too difficult even for a non 
'programmer'.","2002-03-11","20"

is there any directions - or frozen ?.
James Thompson (jamest) said there was 
nothing in stone - but jcater has been the only one coding on it - 
so I imagine the docs are all in that head of his :) - or in some text 
files in the reports/doc dir. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
the code works - the biggest hang up is we
need to 'define' our tags - several of us have mentioned some things 
but no one made a 'proposal' - once that is done i can do XSLT style 
sheets against them. Bajusz asked what was meant by 'tags.' 
Derek said these would cover setup and 
layout - so you might hae like - 
<title>my foo report</title>. This was documented 
at 
http://goats.gnue.org/~dneighbo/gnue/reports.txt. He explained 
basically that doc isnt what we WANT -

There are in effect two different projects at work here. The first one 
is a database-backed application framework. Several of us are using the
Forms and Designer components in a production (or commercial) 
environment in 2-tier mode (i.e., the client talks directly to the 
database and doesn't delegate any logic to an application server 
middleware). The Application Server (GEAS) is being reworked and is 
not, to my knowledge, used in production environment. When you see 
comments about not preserving backwards compatability, they are 
referring to GEAS.","2002-03-12","20"

The second part, actual business applications (such as financials,

that datasource editor predated schema

would like to see us get more into database space i.e. show a tree 
view of drivers installed and let you config them and set optoins

"514","224","2","Derek said 
that guy in here today yogurt (dont know exact nick) wanted dynamic

up and select a driver, select a database, select a table, select some 
fields - and it opens in a wxGrid. At first i was like just make a 
form, but then i recalled that i had such a tool i made in delphi one 
afternoon that was EXTREMELY valuable - as it was a real easy way to 
view data in a lightweight way without having to make forms. 
Jason said not sure I see how this is 
different than our ""multi-row"" layout option in the Simple 
Wizard. Derek said he thought it 
might be a decent usage of gnue common outside gnue :) - not saying WE 
should author it :). Jason said my 
only fear is that has SO much in common with forms that there 
was a danger of feature-creep.","2002-03-12","20"

asked how would that work w/multiple 
keys? Derek suggested you can 
highlight multiple on both sides. Jason emphasised that the 
master-detail wizard had been a sample wizard 
to show what designer could do AS IT SITS :) - never said it was the 
best or final way ;). Derek said the wizard could also ask 
how many rows the detail is if you choose 
grid. Jason said he had been torn about this - 
as that isn't actually a ""grid"" 
wizard but a simple demo wizard and I don't want to keep cramming 
options in that simple wizard. Derek suggested

Michael wasn't sure how we should approach 
that.... Derek suggested for now 
call it DCL - we havent worked out specifics of GNUe DCL - i imagine as
it advances it will be - GNUe HelpDesk, GNUe Project Managment, or 
something - but we are a ways off from that :). Michael said 
it's a tricky thing, since DCL has built its 
own brand. Derek said i think 
initially DCL is like Bayonne in that its a project under GNUe - 
but it slowly will start to get GNUe front ends (but still keep its 
back ends) and then over time start to use contacts module of gnue, 
accounting module of gnue, invoice, etc etc - here then it will be 
uch more of a 'hybrid'. Michael suggested 
I would reserve GNUe DCL for a GNUe 
framework implementation - like your DCL forms. Derek agreed - 
basically there are still tons of steps 
:) - but the first and biggest has been taken, and that is to work 
together on a much deeper level than just acknowledging one anothers 
projects as a nicety - but rather immerse the visions of both projects 
into a reality. He admitted this sounded like 
marketing spew, but blamed the 
Kernel Cousins, as i know i will be 
quoted :).","2002-03-13","20"
"519","226","1","Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked how would 
I get real functionality with just a 2-tier app? - ie. its just a data 
in/out app, not much functionality beyond that. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said there's no less functionality 
than in n-tier mode - it's just where does the functionality 
lie. Charles asked so how do I get 
""external"" functionality?  such as, data is inputed, email of
data is sent - without having something monitor the database 
tables? Peter Sullivan (psu) suggested 
attatch a trigger to something on the form
e.,g the submnit button & write some python to do it. 
Jason agreed - it would be no different than 
in n-tier mode -  in n-tier you have triggers watching transactions at 
the middle-ware level. Nick Rusnov suggested 
you could put a pl/sql trigger in no?.
Peter said this would be d/b specific - 
a forms trigger will work with any back end. Charles asked 
how would a trigger execute code?. 
Jason explained that was what a Forms trigger was - this wasn't a 
database-level trigger. Nick said the reason 
I liked the database level trigger is you only have to deal with 
sending mail in one spot then and get mail working on one 
computer. Charles agreed, saying that he might have a mix of 
different operating systems running the Forms client. Jason suggested 
when that's a big deal for my stuff, I just 
have an xml-rpc instance running on the server to listen for those 
events. Nick also suggested you could 
have like a webform email thing and url encode it. its hacky 
though. Charles asked with DB 
triggers, is there a ""mail function"" or a method of executing
external scripts?. Nick noted that in 
postgres you can embed a perl scrip.t or a 
pl/sql script - I know in perl its pretty easy to send mail 
:).","2002-03-13","20"

Linux User Group in Arizona, USA

After midnight, Derek said the 
presentation went very well about 45 - 50 folks there. He 
gave an overview of gnue (slide based) 
- then did demo of designer to build a video collection database. 
The general sentiment was - THIS KICKS ASS - how come your web site 
doesnt say that it is this far along? He said 
i was pretty amazed at the response 
truthfully - not so much that they liked it but really liked it - 
i didnt know how well the presentation woudl be excepted :) - 
thought maybe the 'hacker' coolness level was too low :). 
Peter Sullivan (psu) suggested I suppose
one of the lessons of free s/w is that people don;t necess get 
impressed by what you expect. GNUe is ultimately about ERP - but 
even today we have a set of tools that are  a good free alternative 
for the sort of quick hack d/b apps that people tend to use M$ 
Access or Delphi etc for. However, 
because GNUe tools can use 
""industrial strength"" d/b backend - be it postgres, SAP, 
or one of the non-free alternatives - it becomes far more 
scalable. David McWherter (dtm) said he had seen a major 
department in a multi-national company 
abusing Excel as its ERP - yes, the whole org workflow in an Excel 
spreadsheet file alone, and asked ironically 
is gnue compatible with Excel?  
;) Peter said Excel is for 
accountants what emacs is for hackers - i.e. give them the chance 
and they'll never come out of it. He thought 
because of the common pro-XML attitude
gnumeric might be a better choice for working with GNUE than 
Excel. ","2002-03-14","21"

not glamorous? Derek, YOU are not glamorous but I think GNUe is! If 
I can sell it right, at the right time, it could be the reason to
run more Linux around my work place. Thanks for the 
presentation! Derek was very pleased. Nick Rusnov (nickr)

coworkers using access for stuff they SHOULDNT - but using a mainframe 
and DB2 is too tough for them and they just want to get their job 
done. The main thing that stopped GNUe from being used as a 
full ERP platform as of time of writing was 
mostly our lack of application 
services, but that wasn't an absolute, as ERPs had existed 
before Application Servers. However, if 
everyone who was using access today started using gnue instead

The next day, 
Arturas confirmed he was going to use gettext to substitute text 
on forms from English to an end-user's native language. This meant 
all the text in *.py files 
would need translating. He had changed the XML parser to support 
all national symbols, but 
they weren't displaying correctly except in form titles. He had 
asked in the #wxwindows irc channel for some help, but all they 
could suggest was that my system 
may be not configured exactly. He confirmed his code 
takes out strings marked for 
translation - puts into separate file for 
human-translation. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) was very 
impressed - ok so we need to figure 
out the display issue - and we are good to go on basic 
i18n support.","2002-03-18","21"
"529","230","3","The next i18n task would be for 
the applications - i would like to see us have ONE form file

re-do the .gfd (GNUe Forms Definition file)

other wise to make contacts.gfd i18n 
i have to copy the form and hand change all the labels 
etc. However, he would wait and see Arturas's current 
patch first, as we dont have 
applications ready to ship - so the .gfd translation is 
secondary :). This could probably be done 
the xml way which i think is via 
entities. Arturas said the 
parser will need additional modifications - but that won't be a 
problem. Derek suggested putting a 
default language code in the 
gnue.conf file for each user, 
then we could AUTO select the appropriate set of 
labels.","2002-03-18","21"

something like i18n.txt [...] 
with phylosophy and status of i18n [...] what has to be done/what 
way and etc. Derek said that i18n support was important to 
GNUe, as the people that have the most 
interest in GNUe at this point are non English speaking 
countries. Arturas was worried that the display problem could 
become the biggest headache as 
no one no where has no knowledge about 
i18n symbols in all wxwindows. Derek said it might well be a 
configuration problem, in which case it might be worth getting some 
other i18n-based users to test it on 
their configuration. Arturas said this could be done even 
without GNUe installed - All that it 
requires is X,python, and wxwindows. Several people were 
pressed into service to test this, including Derek after Arturas 
confirmed that there should be no 
need for you to change anything in localization - gtk, wxwindows 
.... takes localization info not from linux.","2002-03-18","21"

identified actually needed translating - 
or can we assume 'developers' will speak english? Jason 
suggested I think only text the enduser will 
see should be translated myself. Derek agreed, but noted 
i think he is only doing what we told him 
so he probably woudl agree with us :). Jason said the practical
issue was that the more text was replaced, the 
more translators will have to 
translate - plus it would slow down the program. Derek 
suggested i think a good rule of thumb is 
developer out put should be english only (like the code) - end user 
output should be i18n. This wasn't always a clear distinction, 
however.","2002-03-18","21"

(most important) - LDAP do not provides changelists, 
sync-backs and so on. Directory management for E/AS

you don't do anything without using a transaction object. 
Derek clarified that he was not opposed to a re-write. Jason said 
the place to start was with the GNUe Class Definition (gcd) file 
formats. Daniel said a GEAS re-write was essential 
for a more fully intergated GNUe 
;) He thought gcd files should 
look like ODL files.","2002-03-19","21"
"536","234","1","After spending the best part of two days helping a RedHat GNU/Linux
user get all the dependancies working for GNUe, Derek Neighbors
concluded 
we need to find out how to make a rh7.2 install easier
- maybe i need to look at making rpms. These sorts of 
problems were why he liked Debian GNU/Linux - 
debian install of gnue literally takes 
longer to download than anything else.","2002-03-19","21"
"537","235","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked how to install GNUe as a non-root 
user. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) said the normal install 
tries to copy something in /usr
which you can't do unless you are root. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) suggested 
use cvs if you want to determine WHERE to isntall - 
it ASKS where you want to put 
things iirc - by default i believe it puts in ~/bin/ 
for the executables and ~/gnue/etc/ for the configuration 
files.","2002-03-20","21"
"538","236","1","Marcus Wolf (klog) asked for comments on 

Praefectus TEP. James Thompson said 
quick read thru it makes me think it's somewhat like GNUe, 
except using java instead of python. Marcus had wondered 
maybe there's a way to interoperate with 
gnue - or even merge code 100%. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo)
said we are not java fans, but that 
doesnt rule interoperation or merging out.","2002-03-20","21"
"539","236","2","However, we are all about 'free 
software' and thus on a whole we dont mesh with 'open source' 
ideology always. He explained 
open source is a saying giving source code away is good for business 
and helps the business be more profitable - free software is saying 
sharing is good (giving source is part of sharing) and if that helps 
a busieness and profits great if not too bad. 
Marcus asked if free soft as opposed to 
open source not only implies obligation of providing source with 
software but also provide software at no cost?. Derek said 
we are not saying you cant make money 
with free software - it was about freedom rather than zero 
price, although in practice free software tended to be distributed 
at zero or nominal cost. Marcus thought this was splitting hairs - 
i want to code ! Derek said 
honestly that is an acceptable
answer - in fact its the answer many people here have - and there isnt 
anything wrong with it.","2002-03-20","21"
"540","236","3","Later, Derek said from the sounds of 
it we would love to have you work on geas v2 - as it seems this 
praefectus seems very similar to it. Alternatively, 
you could make our forms engine, 
reporting engine etc talk to praefectus. However, 
any time spent on interoperation
is time lost to bring products forward. Marcus agreed.","2002-03-20","21"
"541","236","4","Derek said that the new GEAS would be in python, whereas the old 
one had been C. The main reason for this change was 
because we have somethign called 
gnue-common in python that handles rpc abstraction, database 
abstraction, xml parsing etc which the new GEAS would use.
Also, coding in python is MUCH more 
maintainable and quicker to write code in. Performance was 
as good as java's - no one tries to kid 
someone that its as fast as C. However, 
converting python code to C isnt a huge
jump - so if we start seeing bottlenecks we convert those pieces to 
C - for now maintainablity is more important than speed to us
(as is for java developers) - as in enterprise development speed of 
development and maintainability is much higher cost than the speed at
which it runs. In practice, GNUe Common was already in use 
in two-tier environments (i.e. without the caching of GEAS) and 
regularly is pulling about 3million 
records off an OS/390 mainframe running IBM DB2.","2002-03-20","21"
"542","236","5","Marcus asked is geas object management 
hierarchy based? would you have any interest for that, and strong 
security? really is about seeing where i could help. hierachy = tons 
of interesting things - it could bring authority spaces, common 
namespace between multiple object servers, etc.
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said Role Based Access Control 
is desired. Marcus suggested 
geas could be b2 graded ;). 
Nick said only if the undelying OS is also 
b2, no? He thought It'd be nice to 
have OS-level RBAC - maybe the Hurd can have that.","2002-03-20","21"
"543","236","6","Derek said we are interested in 
security specifically RBAC but we
are NOT willing to dicate an OS one needs to run GNUe. He 
suggested klog you would have to read 
stan's proposal on security on the website. He said 
one of the philophies of gnue is we dont
try to impose things - even security wise - as while a bank wants 
rock hard security - someone in a small shop may not want the 
hassle. Marcus agreed - pluggable 
would be a good thing - pluggable authentication, access control and 
audit.","2002-03-20","21"
"544","236","7","Derek thought Marcus would find learing python easy - 
if you know C/C++/Java its hardly called
'learning'. Marcus said i fear 
python as the day you introduce 
security - everything changes in terms of performance. 
Derek said we have had several C die 
hards in here - that went to python kicking and screaming - 
and almost every single one of them hasnt touched C since learning 
python. Python wouldn't be any slower than java. 
Marcus said actually i was thinking about a 
rewrite in C for his application server anyway. Derek said C 
wasn't ideal for security - C forces 
you to manage memory and such - and MUCH more susceptible to buffer 
overflows and such - and yes i know the argument that good C 
programming doesnt have htis issue - but i like to counter with well
bad java/python/etc dont have it. He said 
we think of python as a good prototyping
language that is suitable for real work as well - but we arent 
unwilling to drop to C when performance is an issue. 
In practice, bad C could be slower than good python. Nick said 
the hardest part of python is breaking C 
habits and structuring it like a python program.","2002-03-20","21"
"545","236","8","Marcus asked do you think there is a 
really opportunity to build businesses around gnue? that would 
provide gnue-related services? John Lenton (Chipaca) said 
Well we certainly think so :) 
Marcus said with closed source software, 
i'm alone - most likely will never market the software since lack of
time and capital - free software, if there is a possibility to build
something real - with large network of people around it, than i'm in
 ;). Nick said yea - nice community 
- very fuzzy. Marcus asked whether GNUe project members were
mainly coders or business people here? with 
studies in business? James Thompson (jamest) said Neil Tiffin
and Derek Neighbors were more focused on the business analyst side - 
they are tech people turned managers or 
something - scary :) The thread degenerated into abuse about
the type of cheap aftershave that business-type people wore.","2002-03-20","21"
"546","236","9","Derek said that typically a software 
house provided a wide range of services besides licensing 
software. for gnue because its complex 
there is money to be made in a. instaling the software

most of the money will be in customization(feature enhancement)
and consulting. He suggested that even proprietary ERP 
companies weren't making thier bank on 
licensing fees alone, as you could tell from their pricing 
structures. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested 
of course, to stay on the community's good 
side, we'd expect some code contributions back into our project if 
you're gonna profit off of our hard work :). Derek said 
the ones that are good consultants and 
treat customers right will do just fine imho - i wouldnt expect a 
free software consultant using gnue to be a millionaire
- but i would suspect one day they could live comfortably

the continued developement it requires.","2002-03-20","21"

independent of arturas' stuff.

Jason Cater (jcater) noted that the Debian package for 
gnue-common is marked as 
Section: interpreters, which he didn't think was right. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) wondered if it was

(stupid reason). Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
our debian stuff needs a LOT of work - 
better debconf stuff - and get it working - and do apache style packaging - 
as well as good descriptions, keywords etc :) 
He was pleased that the Debian GNU/Linux packages for 
GNUe had been started, however. Nick Rusnov (nickr) 
suggested filing bugs, lots of them - 
they are official packages, you send a well 
structured mail to submit@bugs.debian.org - read the website 
bugs.debian.org I think to figure out the format. Derek 
said he would also like 
to get the source of the packages in our tree and learn how they work.

highly involved in the project (um jbailey)

as maurizo does out of kindness.","2002-03-20","21"
"549","239","1","Harald Mayer (Harald1) asked is 
anything decided about how the merge will be executed? 
will only the db-structure of dcl stay? Derek 
Neighbors (derek) said this was 
not fully decided - the first thing you will see is that dcl
is getting more external development - as of today some rbac 
stuff was submitted as a patch - while it might not be the 
long term direction it solves some important issues 
immediately - also in the cvs head branch you will notice 
GNUe Forms (non web screens) for DCL being checked in - the 
contact management portion will be much much more robust in 
next DCL - and probably even further extened into real CRM in 
the GNUe CRM stuff. If the database structure of DCL 
did have to change, then the 
upgrade path will handle any changes needed. As well 
as the GNUe Forms for DCL in CVS, he also had 
some others too that arent in cvs 
that need cleaning up but which were in his home directory
on the GNUe webserver.","2002-03-21","22"
"550","240","1","Talking further about the issues raised in 
, 
Sacha Schlegel (SachaS) said that the 
openebxml laboratory in sweden has about 5 ""scientists"" 
doing projects for and around it. The people have different projects.
They are placed between computer science and business. 
They want to realise business solutions with computer science help.
They wanted to model business processes using tools like UML, but also
have executable models. so you model 
then ""save"" and ""start"".. Reinhard 
Müller (reinhard) thought a tool to convert UML to GNUe Application 
Server Class Definitions would be useful - 
that's what we are planning anyway - at 
least it was my understanding - to have a ""designer"" for 
geas - that will work on a high level and save it into xml files and/or
database.","2002-03-21","22"
"551","240","2","Sacha also mentioned BPML 
Business Process Modelling Language.
This allowed you to model the 
enterprise business. the next step is inter-enterprise business
and there you can model with ebXML (electronic business XML).
ebXML focues heavily on inter enterprise business, called collaborations.
However, you need some kind of mapping
between the BPML models of the inside of enterprises and the ebXML models of the 
inter-relations between enterprises. He was still keen on doing some academic
research on some topic around ebXML or enterprise modelling.","2002-03-21","22"
"552","240","3","
The next day, Sacha explained 
BPML is a meta language.
- basically a xml vocabulary for business processes. 
He wasn't sure what was meant by a business process. 
Reinhard suggested an algorithm for the business. 
Sacha said so basically BPML has some tags which people can 
use to describe their business processes (as mentioned yesterday, mainly 
for enterprise business processes). According to the specification, 
A process is a specific ordering of work 
activities across time and place, with a beginning, an end, and clearly 
defined inputs and outputs. He noted 
the main entities of the BPML vocabulary are: - messages, - 
participants, - activites, - rules, -transactions and - processes.
However, I guess there is no software out there yet which 
""simply"" parses it and executes it and voila you have a system which 
handles your processes. Maybe GNUe would end up as such a system.","2002-03-21","22"
"553","240","4","
Some days later, Sacha apologised for saying in his paper that 
there is so much missing from GNUe at 
time of writing. Derek thought that was fair comment, but rather than 
say its like a car with out a motor -
it should read its like a motor w/o a car. He said 
I really really want to get some gnue 
apps out the door -  even if they are not the 'official' n-tier spec.
He posted a link to Sacha's article on the GNUe website -
its actually a pretty darn good little 
research paper - i recommend reading it if you are interested in such 
glamorous and exciting things as electronic business :).","2002-03-21","22"
"554","241","1","Harald Meyer (Harald1) pointed out that the BUGS file was out of date. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that DCL was now the preferred method of 
recording bugs for the GNUe project - soon 
the bugs file should be generated from there - 
until then consider the bugs file out of date :). 
There was a guest account 
on the DCL server, 
but it was read-only. Soon there would be a gateway so that e-mails 
sent to the bugs@gnuenterprise.org address would automatically 
raise a job in DCL. People who intended being active bug loggers 
could contact Derek for a 'personal' DCL username and password.","2002-03-21","22"
"555","242","1","Linas Vepstas (linas) asked anyone 
here discussing how to use glade to hook up to gnue forms?
James Thompson (jamest) said that the first version of GNUe Forms 
was to base on glade code which was a mistake - 
they have different targets. Linas said he realised 
glade won't run on win or mac, that is not my 
concern.. With a bit of care, the XML definitions for GNUe 
Forms could also be compatible with Glade. James asked 
so glade would draw the form and 
gfclient would run it, is that what you are saying? 
He didn't see what this would gain. Linas said I've 
got to develop a pretty looking glade app; its gotta be pretty or they'll
make me code in VB. Ughh.  I'm using glade and some custom gtk widgets.
Its mostly data-driven: which means most of it is gnue-forms-like - 
so I'm scratching my head: what's the easiest way from here to there?
I could do it from scratch, I could enhance gnue-forms, I could try 
bond/bonddb. He said every 
half hour I change my mind. The from-scartch approach is to 
hack some xml that hooks up odbc table.fields to libglade widget 
names.  Should be easy, but ... but it leaves me cold for a 
long-term strategy (reports, etc.). He needed to be able to 
support a mxiture of buttons, menus, 
radio/select, text areas with padding and glitz. He 
also have some custom scrolling 
strip-chart widgets and a satellite photo map underlay 
which he already had working, but now 
I have to hook up a bunch of forms to a database thats the 
easy/hard part - easy but tedious; alternately, hard if I try 
to merge into gnue :-(.","2002-03-21","22"
"556","242","2","Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said linas 
glade support is a WASTE - if you want glade use glade - 
our designer IMHO is superior to glade at this point and cross platform. 
i assume your ""issues"" are either a. lack  of 'cool' widget support
or b. you desire native gtk. If you want (a) forms really isnt too 
interested in that, i suggest just using glade. If you desire native gtk
simply write a UIgtk.py file. I personally see glade as having nothing
to do with forms. James suggested you 
may want to see about mixing and matching, using forms where it 
saves you time - as designer wizards make that part so easy - 
but dropping to glade where you need the glitz. 
Derek said a year ago, someone could 
convince me that perhaps glade could be retrofited to be our designer - 
but honestly now our designer is there and it 'rocks'(tm)
so i cant see going backwards :). He continued 
if you just want easy databinding in glade - 
fsthere are lots of projects that are doing databinding for glade - 
gnome-db being one of them. James said 
it may be possible to extend the forms client 
to do more ie: support widget plugins, but that's going to take work :). 
Derek said, based on previous discussions, 
making gnue MORE complex isnt our goal :).","2002-03-21","22"
"557","242","3","Later, James confirmed we 
constantly have to defend keeping the gfd simple :) 
Linas said he had had similar issues keeping gnucash under 
control - its weird, you want to 
encourage contributors, so you don't want to piss people off, 
but its hard to say ""don't implement that its a bad 
idea"" without pissing them off - or accidentally specing 
something thats too grandioise for them to implement. 
Derek said im all for contributions - 
im just saying what you are proposing doesnt make a lot of sense
as iirc glade has some databinding capablities or so i hear. 
However, it is of course gpl software 
and you can do as you like - and we would support you in it unless 
it was really whacked :)","2002-03-21","22"
"558","243","1","Harald Meyer (Harald1) reported a crash using GNUe Forms on Windows, using 
python 2.2. Derek suggested 2.2 you dont want - 
drop to 2.1 - 2.2 is buggy - you can use it but you wont be able to save forms 
in designer because of a streamIO bug in unicode support w/ 2.2 (still unfixed 
even in last candidate release), as previously discussed in
. 
This meant 
if you save them - reopen them - and save them then a null (^@) 
character would be inserted after EVERY character - 
so you get ^@o^@u^@t^@p^@u^@t^@ like that :) - if you have someone one staff you 
want to 'joke' with - this is one of thsoe good 'joke' bugs :). Some editors
wouldn't display the null characters, but in emacs its 
visible. Harald reported he didn't seem to be having this problem, 
but if i do save->load it crashes. Derek suggested 
is there way you can install python2.1 on that machine 
as well? -  or better yet just grab the 0.1.1 release -  it has all dependencies 
compiled in so to speak. James Thompson (jamest) was impressed that Harald 
had installed GNUe and all the dependancies on Windows from source - 
that's cool, most people use the bins. Derek 
said that Harald's coolness had already been established, 
as he actually submits bug reports :). 
Harald said my win is mostly unix: apache, mysql, 
perl, php, xemacs, gcc, ... Jason Cater (jcater) suggested that Harald was 
effectively running GNU/Win ?. Derek said that 
its scary but i hear pretell that

to be usable via cygwin.","2002-03-22","22"

The next day, harald reported 
I completed the tests with different versions of Designer and python -
should I post the complete results to dcl, as there 
were some more problems with the exe-releases ? Derek requested 
please file the bug - it exists in linux as well 
- i.e. my current cvs does the exact same thing. He 
loves that we have another bug hunter, i was feeling 
so lonely. Harald said that the 0.1.0 gfdesigner 
exe release had several further bugs that the CVS version did not have, 
and It seems that the saving bug is even worse. It 
crashes on other files, too, after one file was saved and closed - but it does 
not crash, when the first file is not closed.","2002-03-22","22"

Derek said the ones in the techref 'should' be 
implemented -  but these are things that unless one of the developers are 
using them, probably are not getting properly regression tested. 
He suggested for the moment testing or looking at the source code to find out -

CVS, and confirmed it crashed. 
Harald said he had already tracked the bug so far down, 
that it happens,if LayoutDesigner's OnDelete is called - though it doesn't crash 
right in there, but sometime later. Daniel asked 
does it crash if you delete a widget a different way?.

supported this, but added please make sure 
we all know what you are talking about - the API between what and

"563","245","1","Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said that the tools 
(forms, designer) are useful enough for 2-tier mode. 
You could use designer and then customize them 
without strong XML knowledge. The modules 
(like accounting, ...) are not ready, apart from DCL - 
they were designed to be used with application 
server and now application server is in rewrite stage. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said The team are all 
volunteers at the moment, so we work w/o deadlines - 
as no-one can tell how much time they will have. 
He said you can certainly use the GNUe tools 
in 2-tier to write apps yourself - If you're looking for 
""shrink-wrap"" install and go Financials, HR, etc
we're not there yet and to be honest we need to get the n-tier tools 
written & working before we start there. Dmitry noted that Forms 
and Designer were available as a bynary snapshot 
for MS (it is single .exe to get forms working). Peter said 
the official release is a few months old, you can 
either use that - or the nightly CVS snapshots. For the server end, 
for the database back-end, use your choice of 
database - for the app-server backend, we have an Application Server that a 
company kindly contributed - but which needs an extensive re-write which is 
just starting. On databases, we currently support loads of free and non-free 
choices - including ODBC (i.e. pretty much anything that has an ODBC 
driver). He noted that Even today, 2-tier 
is a good framework for those sorts of little projects that you start in MS 
Access before you realise you actually need something bigger ;-).","2002-03-26","22"

mutliple client access, including HTML - there was a guy working on a 
pure 
HTML client - 
not sure where that got to we also had someone working on 
a PHP 
client - which I think made more preogress. 
However, In practice, I would expect that using 
complicated forms via web would be quite painful - so power-users would 
probably always want to use a proper Forms client - but for occasional users, 
web is probably fine. Some of our project team are big web-application haters - 
but if you look at DCL, that is exclusively web-based at the moment -
so go figure ;-)","2002-03-26","22"
"565","245","3","Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said currently 
we have a framework but not the 'shrink wrap' applications - so you could 
download and install the framework to use with postgres in probably under 4 hours - 
on debian if you are experienced linux user w/ postgres running probably take you 
about 10 minutes. Although several organisations were using GNUe 
'in production,' this was by using paid consultants or 
in house staff to write the applicatiosn with the framework as 'custom' 
applications. As of time of writing, if 
you just want a 'ledger' you might be able to use gnucash or sqlledger - 
if you want more than that i think gnue is right for you if you are willing to 
put some work into building what you need. He said 
we are looking for people willing to build/use 
applications :) -  the problem is we ahve limited people resources - 
and most of the resources are making the tools better - 
if they stop to build official applications the tools suffer - 
so we are rough spot - more hands help :) - in fact people that are less 
engineer and more consulting type are what we need most :). 
He regretted having to keep pointing interested people to other projects -
i really dont want to point you there would 
MUCH rather have you use gnue - but if it fits your needs better so be it

i for example would say you and i probably really arent really hot on 
tuning up GEAS - as its not our 'domain', so they might as 
well work on 2-tier applications meanwhile. However, Peter said the
problem to me is that a 2-tier gl doesn't

answers. Peter Sullivan (psu) added a few more. Peter and Jason wondered 
about adding a ficticious package at the end such as 
OLAP-u-like or 
EZ-OLAP :). Peter suggested 
sorta like the CowboyNeal option on 
/. polls. Later, Derek 
reported new poll is up.","2002-03-27","22"
"570","248","1","Christian Selig (lupo_) asked is it possible 
that gnue<->mysql interaction sucks a bit, or is it me? 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard said well most of us 
use postgres but it _should_ 
work. Christian pasted his error messages, and proposed some fixes, 
but he rerun it and there is still a 
problem. James Thompson (jamest) explained what was happening. 
Christian said okay, gforms now complains about 
a missing key msg_first when calling gconfig.get('msg_first'). James 
said he wasn't getting that problem. Reinhard pasted 
a part of derek's commit from last night. 
He wondered if anonymous CVS access was a bit 
behind - i think it gets synced nightly (U.S. night that is). James 
said nope, it's instantaneous - pulls from 
the same tree, I use anoncvs for gnue installs other than my own :)
He explained that the code used fetchmany(0) rather than fetchmany() because 
we use the cursor arraysize attribute later in 
the code which is supposed to be used if size isn't specified - it defaults to 
5 - so by setting that to 0 for everyone it seems it'd seem to disable our 
prefetching system. He said that fwiw - 
the mysql db driver may be perfectly fine - what we've noticed is that the 
driver authors all read the spec differently.","2002-03-28","23"
"571","248","2","Christian said i have ""fixed"" the 
problem for now by changing the mysqldb driver - gnue forms now starts and 
after ""execute query"", the first five entries are displayed correctly 
- the sixth one is empty and no further browsing is possible :-(. James 
suggested a quick workarround that sucks - on your 
<datasoure> tags add a cache=####### (some number bigger than the records 
in your db :). Christian thought okay, that 
sucks too much :). Alternatively, James suggested 
replace fetchmany with fetchall() IIRC that should 
work - we had to do that in pygresql driver . Christian said this 
bears similar problems. James said he 
wasn't a mysql user - so I can't really test this 
out. Christian said he would try to squash 
them when i have some time.","2002-03-28","23"
"572","249","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) had added
first and last record calls and corresponding menu options, initially 
for use with DCL. He still need to add buttons 
to the toolbar for them - and bind the keystrokes -  but via menu they work. 
James Thompson (jamest) reminded Derek but you did 
know that jump to record exists right? Derek agreed, but said his additions 
were useful where i do not know exact record i 
want. He pointed out that there was a potential problem with the jump to 
record, in that it traps for if you exceed bound of 
lastRecord - BUT some of our DBdrivers dont support lastRecord, most notably 
ODBC. James said my users want a find function - so 
that they can scan the records in memory for a string of text in any field. 
Derek said he had been looking at something similar.","2002-03-28","23"
"573","249","2","Later, Derek asked how he could map compound 
keystrokes in forms for his new navigation functions. He wanted 
to make last record ctrl+down and first record ctrl+up 
- but i soon found sawfish uses those - so i changed to shift+down & 
shift+up. Jason Cater (jcater) suggested Ctrl+Home 
or Ctrl-End. Derek said he wasn't too fussed, but 
we have screwed concept of blocks :) so pgup/pgdn 
are used (imho) in correctly which was one 
reason i had to do a first/last. He also asked 
say i make a 'grid' by doing rows=""10"" - 
and i load 100 records into that grid - the gripe is you have use arrows to 
navigate - instead of being able to do pg dn/up - to jump like 10 records at a 
time - i realize we have a 'jump' and now a first and last - but how are your users 
responding to this? - or is there another key that will do this kind of navigation? 
- or will this navigation come with the 'scrollbar'? Jason said he was 
planning to do row jumping - just not a high 
priority. He defended our block concept. 
Derek said he still wasn't convinced as to their 
usefulness :)","2002-03-28","23"
"574","250","1","Howard Shaw (grum) asked about the status of 
GNUe forms for HTML/CSS. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said there were 
2 different implementations being built concurrently 
- neither implementation in cvs or being done by core team - one is a 
new forms client written in php 
but using gnue common via xml-rpc (iirc) - it seems to work fairly well but 
havent seen jens for over a week so dont knwo if it will re surface - 
other implementation is in 
webware/python server pages 
and basically is just a 'ui driver' for existing forms implementation - 
havent seen madlocke for month or more so that avenue could be dead.
Howard asked have you ever looked at 
ERW (Entities and Relationships on 
the Web)?  It was hosted on GNU's 
equiv of SourceForge, but I don't think it is a GNU proj. He had 
thought of it when I read the comments in the 
last kernel cousin 
about GNUe becoming an Access replacement.. Derek said 
we dont AIM to be an access replacement - 
more the comment is right now we are a suitable access replacement with 
REAL databases.","2002-03-28","23"
"575","250","2","Howard felt GNUe was selling itself short by not having samples 
readily accessible on the website. Derek agreed - 
we are too heads down in the framework and are 
losing people - because we dont have applications - if we had applications 
(even one moderately sophisticated one) - so people could see the 'power' 
of the framework -  i think many more folks would be using gnue.","2002-03-28","23"
"576","251","1","Howard Shaw (grum) asked does any part of GNUe 
currently handle DB creation? I.e. the actual design and installation of 
tables?. Derek said that we have a 
generic XML formate - that will then create a script for about any db - 
the idea was we would make it so you could do table def in DIA - run a 
style sheet to convert it to our xml db format - and run a style sheet 
to make the create script - at SOME point we will have all a tool do 
this. Howard said he had uncovered 
a java app that takes an XML doc describing a 
set of Entity/Relationships and generates SQL to create the 
tables. Derek said that woudl be a 
fairly trivial task for gnue but wasn't a priority as they 
lack resources. Howard said he 
was thinking about taking this guy's java 
app and rewriting in Python to give a basis for porting to GNUe. 
Derek said the reason he thought this would be fairly trivial was 
its all xml transformation - so if i make 
something in DIA, DIA makes xml  - i simply author an XSLT style sheet 
to convert from DIA to the XML table schema standard of gnue - and gnue 
alread has a set of XSLT style sheets to convert form our table schema 
standard to dbs like mysql, oracle, postgres, etc etc etc - so really 
the only 'task' is to write  style sheet to go from DIA XML to GNUe Table 
Schema XML. He recognised that getting 
it to point where its a nice gui tool - and not using files but rather 
streams etc etc - is a much more laborous venture - but at gnue we like 
to start small that gets a good return on effort and build up. 
A good palce to start would be with straight 
up table definitions in DIA as they are less 'complex' and still get a good 
'bang' for the buck - as if i can basically 'document' my schema in dia - 
i now have a way to generate the actual db w/o doing additional 
work. ","2002-03-28","23"
"577","252","1","Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said he was 
working on a geas proposal. Jason Cater 
(jcater) wondered what the definition files will 
look like. Daniel gave some sample class definitions, written in 
Object Definition Languague (ODL). Jason said he thought they should be 
in XML, as:","2002-03-28","23"
"578","252","2","He added I'm game for whatever - 
but just an observation that we already have an infrastructure for xml. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said basically my 
plans are that [...] the appserver will take the object definition from the 
database and will not mind how they got into the database. People 
could write filters to get object definitions from their own preferred format 
to the object database. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
i think if we dont do xml on the class defs we 
will pay fo rit - and this is a change from my original stance. Reinhard 
said eventually we will have a business object 
designer where i can model my objects visually at which point the object 
definition file format would be less important. Derek hoped this would be sooner 
rather than later - as we can use existing 
designeer :). People could always just edit 
the xml file or whatever the definition is in that way too using their 
favourite text editor, whether emacs or vi.","2002-03-28","23"
"579","252","3","Daniel just whipped up 
a 
quick diagram. Looking at it, he concluded xml 
would be asier to parse... [...] ok, jcater you just may indeed get your xml 
definitions ;). He said we just need designer 
to let us design business objects then ;) Jason confirmed that Designer 
was meant to be all purpose - it's modularized 
:) Daniel suggested I think odl vs. xml is a 
debate for another time as those are implementation issues that can be worked out 
after the apis are defined - but I think I like xml too - I'm torn. 
Derek said one of the reasons we keep saying 
XML is designer is good at reading/writing XML :) - so with a lot LESS work - 
we can have an visual appserver tool. ","2002-03-28","23"
"580","252","4","
The next day, Daniel and Reinhard discussed Daniel's diagram further. 
Daniel explained that Object Definition Languague would be the 
equivalent of GNUe Class Definitions (.gcd), and the ODL compiler would 
be the equivalent of the GCD parser. The arrows on the diagram 
represented flow of direction. 
The odl compiler creates code stubs 
(generation) - I figured why not 
since we are using a dynamicaly typed langauge 
and we could have the methods then hook into the methods adapter.
Reinhard warned not sure if i am a friend 
of self modifying code. Daniel pointed out that 
everytime you change the idl interfaces in 
current geas the idl-compiler modifies the stubs ;) Reinhard 
agreed, but not at runtime - 
in normal use the interface doesn't get changed. 
He said i can imagine it could be hell 
to debug such a thing - not sure if it's easy to debug code that doesn't 
even exist as a source file.","2002-03-28","23"
"581","252","5","Daniel emphasised we can just have tools 
that use the api too and go backwards to odl descriptions, in fact we can 
go either way - that was the point of the diagram - say you used a tool 
that add a Class class - then it could generate an odl and that can be 
preprocessed into python code stubs. Reinhard suggested 
those python stubs would be
class definitions for the business objects, and said 
i think i like that :).","2002-03-28","23"
"582","252","6","Reinhard was not too hot about 
odl. Daniel said it's very similar 
to current gcds - has 'relationships' to maintain referntial intergrity - 
like if one object has a relationship to another and then object goes 
away you can clean it up so it doesn;t refer to it anymore - 
it's just idl witha  few extras. Reinhard said that 
it should not need a programmer to define 
objects [...] we have to think in user space. Daniel asked 
ok, but how do you envision us bridgin the 
gap? odl is just our internal object description format (or could be) - 
we need tools to make describing business processes easy right - 
and then from that meta info we generate code and methods?
He said you would need to map business 
concepts to object concepts right? for code generation - now, can we do 
this in layers? like deal with an appserver that uses object descriptions 
etc, then abstract that up to a business process mapping?  or would it be 
better to include a busines process thing at the core somwhere?. 
Reinhard said he did not see much difference 
between a business object and a ""normal"" object. Daniel 
asked do we use odl and then have a business 
process mapping to objects or do we use some format already that 
incorporates business process stuff?","2002-03-28","23"
"583","252","7","Reinhard said that a business process would be something 
like - first a order is entered, then it 
must be printed out - then the boss must check it - then it is faxed to 
the supplier etc. - this is what 
derek calls ""workflow"" and i don't think this should be _in_ 
the appserver Daniel agreed but it 
could be an easy way for people to 'design' thier business software
instead of writing gcds [...] say if it was gra[hical and we had more 
'concepts' and components - a sorta 'dummy' layer for them to customize
GNUe. Reinhard commented i would 
say that navigator will do such a thing - like listing the actions in the 
logical order - like you have a menu where you see all actions in the 
order they have to happen. Daniel said 
I thought right now all it did was make 
menus. Reinhard agreed, but said geas 
will provide business objects - and workflow is the way how these objects 
are _used_ -  but doesn't have impact on their definitions.","2002-03-28","23"
"584","252","8","Daniel asked how does the business guy designa 
GNUe pacakeg then? ;) - wouldn't that 
visual designer somehow eventually create the object definitions to carry out 
theri design? and maybe even generate method code if it was generic 
enough?. Reinhard suggested the 
visual designer _will_ create the object definition - it will probably not 
create method code however. Daniel suggested 
well stubs at least. 
Reinhard agreed - it is a software to software 
information transfer -  not a human to software information transfer - 
and for software to software transfers XML is the best method. 
Daniel suggested well you could markup odl in 
an xml format - just like you could for any format - to make the xml gods 
happy ;) - or should that be 'gurus'? He noted that 
OIF is a data exchange format for the objects - 
and someone was nice and made an xml markup of that and you can download it 
off the odmg site. He suggested so 
mayeb having that be xml would appease everyone. However, 
that really doesn't define the 'schema' of the 
object(s) though as ODL (GCD) does.","2002-03-28","23"
"585","253","1","Jason Cater (jcater) said that Forms and Designer were coded 
in python. GNUe Application Server (GEAS) had originally been written in 
C, but it is being rewritten in python - we have an extensive 
common library for python - that all the other tools already used - that was already far 
ahead of geas - so it made sense to reuse a lot of this. Some doubts were 
expressed whether python would be fast enough for an Application Server. Jason said 
the beauty of python is its integration with c - it's trivial 
to prototype an app in python and get it going quickly and find the pieces that are slow
and recode those in C - of course, we've yet to have to do that for any of the other 
tools - so we're pleased w/python - but the main benefits are speed of deployment and 
ease of maintenance He added incidentally, from 
experience, I don't buy the ""it needs to be in C or C++"", myself - I do 
understand where that comes from - esp. when people try to do such servers in java
and they churn along slowly. Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) added 
python is like delphi/powerbuilder done properly w/o an 
ide - i.e. it isnt as strongly typed (as pascal) but implements lists and dictionaries 
as data types and is highly object friendly - i.e. python the language is better than 
pascal the language - but as a visual tool delphi wins as it has a much better visual 
component model in the VCL - but it isnt really xplatform like python. On the 
issue of using python for GEAS instead of C, i will start 
by saying 95% of the appserver market today is contained in java based appservers - i 
believe in many areas python is faster than java or equal to - so if java is up to the 
task i see no reason to believe python is not. He said 
because a vendor says C++ is only way to do appserver i 
dont believe it, adding i have long ago learned 
that using a 'faster' tool doesnt always make for a 'faster' product - example our old 
appserver was in C - yet our python common libraries were beating it in 
performance. He liked python's error handling - it 
is a 'safe' language much as java was supposed to be. He thought python was the 
right choice for the new GEAS as a. its being done in a 
distributed development environment (so readability and maintainibity) are HIGH priority 
for productivity and b. most businesses will 
sacrifice speed in favor of having a maintainable system that is stable. If some 
parts needed to run quicker, since we are highly modular - 
we can port modules to C to get performance.","2002-03-29","23"

The next day, Derek said i meant to bug you about

He wanted to use pre-commit post-commit triggers 
at 'form' level iirc but i dont know how i would change the records that had been 
'updated'. Jason Cater (jcater) said for your

sequence. He said he would write the code for the datasource-level 
triggers next week if you need it - shouldn't be hard now 
that jamest has the common-based trigger system. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
asked is that common based trigger system supposed to 
support multiple languages?. Jason confirmed this - 
the common trigger system defines namespaces - which is a 
small step from language-independence, although we 
haven't experimented with other languages other than python as at time of 
writing. Daniel said he was interested because we 
have this thing we called GEMA - GNUe Methods Adapter which was in the 
proposals for the new GNUe Application Server (GEAS) - 
it's the multi-langauge methods thing.

called ""for each pending record"" plus
you have <pre-insert>, <pre-delete> and 
<pre-update> which all get called for records that 
were inserted, deleted, and modified (but not inserted or

"592","256","3","Later, Daniel confirmed we 
are rewriting in python and integrating with common ;) He felt 
they really need to document common better though - 
as I read the code and I immediately get lost in the details ;). He had 
been looking at the triggers stuff and GObject. 
He thought the triggers look very formsish though 
and wondered how this would fit with GNUe Application Server (GEAS).
He had I thought the 'methods' or 
'trigger' system was going to be more of a generic object thing that 
could be shared.","2002-03-31","23"
"593","256","4","He had also thought GObject might 
also fit the ODMG Object Model by adding that api to it - the 'Object' 
api. He liked Gnome's concept 
of GObject and i see no reason why 
we shouldn't have something similar. Andrew suuggested 
a GNUeObject?. He said 
neilt's pic for GEAs makes stuff a bit simpler 
to understand - so everything will basically be a python object? :) -
you want them to all derive from the mighty GNUeObject, so that 
they all have common methods, attributes?. Daniel thought 
that would be cool.
Andrew felt it's a logical way to do 
things, in my limited experience :), adding 
for each .gcd defined object, they 
implicitly derive from the base GNUeObject. Daniel said 
this linked to his ideas on ODMG, because 
odmg calls for one that implements certain metods for persistence, and
they use one for an object that cna be described using xml.","2002-03-31","23"
"594","256","5","Andrew said that we're in agreement 
then over GObject/GNUeObject, and the next step was 
we'd need to agree on what common 
methods/attributes each child inherits. Daniel said he 
was thinking that the 'Object' inteface in 
odmg would be implemented by the current GNUeObject/GObject that lives 
in GObjects.py This could support not only ODMG stuff, but also
all common things that are base to our object 
system, imho. Andrew said this would 
make it easy for people writing business 
objects, give them a nice base to work with :).","2002-03-31","23"
"595","256","6","He thought the object repository will be 
interesting to build. Daniel said I 
see that as a ODL or ODL markup langauge repository which could 
be used in several ways, similar to smalltalk 
binding. He would explain more later. Andrew asked 
what holds the state of each object instance? 
the database?. Daniel said ODL also 
does 'state' of an object rather than just 'interface' - tha database will 
have the 'state'; of source. Andrew noted that 
the state is basically just the attribute values 
anyway :). Daniel suggested you could do 
lazy loading via a proxy - use a reference and only hit the db for the object 
state if it is used - lieka  smart pointer in c++.","2002-03-31","23"
"596","256","7","Andrew clarified so objects & methods are 
still quite separate? Daniel agreed, but suggested 
we should have a methods adapter or 'server' 
even. That way you could get the meta objects - 
process the odls - go in any direction - get the python stubs. 
Andrew asked about multi-threading, warning python 
doesn't scale wonderfully when doing MT, from what i hear Daniel 
said there were several ways of doing this: one 
thread per transaction, one thread doing database operations, under one transaction,
multiple threads each with their own separate transaction and so on. 
However, programmers must not pass objects from one 
thread to another running under a different transaction - multiple threads sharing 
one or more transactions is difficult and requires the client to do concurrency 
control. He noted that the 'Object' interface 
also support locking and concurrency according to the code.","2002-03-31","23"
"597","256","8","He also liked the metadata 
interface - and the Database interface support a schema() 
operations which wil allow you to traverse the metaobject 
graph of the 'object repository' - every object will have 
a class and a metaobject describing the object - so you get 
your intropection. He also thought 
the Database and Transaction 
interfaces are very cool - they are the last 2 in 
odmg.txt He liked the idea of using ODMG, as 
I just didn't want to bother 
designing my own interfaces when there's something out there 
already ;).","2002-03-31","23"

The next day, Daniel asked why 
do triggers look so form-like? - wouldn't it be nice to have a 
common object model that was ui independent? James 
Thompson said it's not ui dependent - 
any object in a gfobj tree can expose itself to 
triggernamespace. Daniel pointed out that 
it uses the 'events' that the forms 
like, such as 
pre-focus....blah, saying 
that's a ui widget thing is it 
not?. Derek Neighbors (derek) said that

what would really really really really help

our own to avoid phantom reads and similar problems. 
His proposed locking model is consistent 
with OMG's concurrency service model althought we can do more 
sophisticated locking than their 'pessmistic' locking model - 
basicaly we want the system to remain consistent and users to have 
isolation until someone commits the transaction. James 
said he would have to think about this 
some - as it may graft in ok to our datasource model but he 
would need to give it some 
thought.","2002-03-31","23"

tried out the simple wizard which does it's job perfectly well - 
but i don't underschtand the master/detail wizard. 
James Thompson (jamest) explained 
master/detail relationships are primary/foreign key setups - 
you choose a table that is the master - 
then link other tables to it via a matching field. 
He explained master/detail is old 
oracle terminology that jcater and I are both used to using. 
He remembered one thing I still need to 
add to that wizard is page support. He explained 
pages are just like pages of a book - 
you can have a form that is several pages long.","2002-04-01","23"
"604","257","2","Christian asked why aren't the position
(x,y,w,h) attributes in the properties window? James explained 
the x, y, width, height properties are in 
the properties window - they are also at the bottom of the screen - 
you may have to scroll down a bit to see them. There was a known 
bug that sometimes you can't edit the properties
on a window with a scrollbar - if you increase the size of the property 
window to get rid of the scroll bar then it will work - major PITA i 
know.","2002-04-01","23"
"605","257","3","Christian also asked is it possible to
create a form which only gives a ""basic info"" on a data set, 
and on clicking a button, opens a more complete view? James 
replied right now, no - it's easy to 
create the two forms and have a button launch the more detailed form - 
however we don't have a system for seeding the detail form with query 
values - it would be a very nice feature though","2002-04-01","23"

it as an article (intro) - but we really need a raw tutorial as

not where the .gpd lives?. James Thompson (jamest) said 
IIRC you can set that in gnue.conf.
Derek said the problem there is its 
still relative i think - but more so if you have lots of different 
gnue apps by different developers - you wouldnt want this to be the 
same. He confirmed that if you used an absolute path in 
gnue.conf, it was just appended: No 
such file or directory:
'/home/dneighbo/gnue//home/dneighbo/cvs/fsfoffice/contacts/phone_type.gfd'

mind if alter navigator?. He noted that 
you define 'type' yet you 
always start GNUe Forms. I'm 
thinking we define in gnue.conf runCommands for report, designer, 
forms, etc. James Thompson said 
i added a type=app - 
where you can use any valid shell command. Derek 
found the _runApp functionality, and commented 
thats what you get for misleading 
docs :) This was the cue for the usual round of 
'Documentation? We have doccumentation?' comments. Derek said he 
would take a stab at adding 
support for the other GNUe tools - unless 
you want to save it for arturas -  should be able to pretty much use 
the form code. The big problem is reports isnt full fleshed out so 
its kind of a moving target - well i guess not too much.","2002-04-02","23"
"609","260","1","Derek Neighbors (deke) noted that, where 
querys span pages then 
if i go to tab one and do a query - 
then go to tab two and do a query - then go back to tab one - 
the result set is gone in tab one. He had been trying to 
do a contact manager databse as one 
form - and each one of the tables on a 'tab' - but i think instead 
will go back to original way of individual forms and use 
navigator. James Thompson (jamest) noted 
entering a query clears all blocks on the 
form - i guess it should only clear the current block and it's 
children. Jason Cater (jcater) said I'm 
torn, adding my knee-jerk reaction is 
a user-initiated query should clear the entire form - but a 
trigger-generated query should be able to do both - I do think 
detail blocks would always be cleared. Derek said 
fwiw i ran into this before but slightly 
different scenario - i know that THIS usage of forms is not typical
and have no problem doing single forms for it. However, 
some day a more realist need could 
come up. James said I've some forms 
where i could use something similar but I'm not 100% sold on the idea 
either - it's a pretty simple change IIRC. Derek said

to sit on if we choose.","2002-04-02","23"

agreed, but I have no clean, secure way 
to pass username/password info around - and putting it on the gfclient 
command line would be insane. Jason Cater (jcater) 
said the plan was to not use 
""gfclient formname"" but to create an actual GFClient.py

CORBA instead of SOAP. James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
CORBA is very close to COBRA and snakes are 
cool.  SOAP implies bathing and no one in here does that. Actually 
CORBA was mature at the time that was decided...we really want to be 
transport independent. Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
added the most important thing is that 
with gnurpc in common soon we can support any RPC you want - 
XML-RPC will be teh first to be heavily tested as its the protocol the 
FSF has decided to make its standard for interoperation for now - when 
we chose CORBA it and MS DCOM were the only VALID choices (read that

I have to reread the quick guide to packaging to figure out 
the best way to do it. I think it'll involve wrapping

It was placed up for adoption and I've 
announced my intention to adopt it already. He thought 
Maybe we should get a 
debian-gnue@lists.debian.org setup for good group discussion, 
and do the uploaders thing. Derek Neighbors (derek) 
suggested feel free to use the

advantage of a Debian list just ofr packaging is visibility..
Also, while you're different, most upstream

a list organised. Jeff warned it

The next day, Jeff noted that There are 
apparently only 5 users of dcl, based on the figures reported 
by the Debian

there are lots of dcl users (more than 5)
BUT i would imagine probably none of them installed from the debian

deal.","2002-04-03","24"

personally, despite the lack of budgeting
- and the reporting sucks. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
I plan to use GNUe for personal finances?
what's the big deal? plus then the wifey can use it on her Win98

you formalized the 'tags' yet for NORMAL reporting? if so im ready to

"619","266","2","Jason really wants to see an XML to XSLT 
converter :). Derek said i might 
try a convertor tonight to html, using 
pysablot, although he wished 
there were Debian packages for this. Jason asked 
nickr: yes, could you package 
pysablot.sf.net?? - /me would 
be your best friend - or at least nicer to you than I am to 
chillywilly ;) Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested using 
4front instead - which is already 
packaged. Jason noted that sablotron 
plus the perl and php bindings are already in woody - just no python 
bindings. Derek said he had mainly used sablotron, 
as its what mdean and i found to have 
best docs :) - both beign new to xslt this was important :) - 
we got it working for DCL - and it seems very easy and simple to 
use - and has a plethora of bindings. Nick said 
I was going to use sablotron at one time 
but then I found 4front which did everything I needed. 
Christian Selig (sledge_) recommended 
the XSLT FAQ - 
it's a faq for those who already use 
xslt - it gives some good advice on the more tricky issues 
:-).","2002-04-03","24"
"620","266","3","
Two days later, Jason asked nickr: 
did we ever volunteer you to package pysablot for us?
Nick replied you tried to convince me 
- but I'm whiley. Jason explained that psyablot was 
a a wrapper to sablotron, 
which was an XSL processor fully 
implemented in C++. Nick pointed out that 
you guys do know that pysablot was 
last released in nov 2000? and that its still alpha?
He said he would make a deb of it, but 
I don't think I should put it in the debian archive if 
it wasn't being actively maintained. Derek said that there 
was a freeze on new packages until the May 1st release of 
Debian woody (as the new stable distribution) anyway. He didn't 
think that it was a problem that there had been no more recent 
releases of psyablot - i mean all 
it is a wrapper to sablotron - and from what i have used it 
works w/o issue - and seemed to have all functionality - 
so unless sablotron changes i wouldnt expect a lot from pysablot 
to change - i am willing to contact the maintainer of pysablot to 
see if they have abandoned it or not. If so, 
i will probably see if he is willing 
to turn it over - call me sick but i like it :). He 
thought it was important, as iirc 
there were only like 2 or 3 xslt packages for python - 
sablotron and pysablot were the only combo that were BOTH GPL - 
i also liked that sablotron is maintained by a commercial 
company that puts money into the development. Nick 
pointed out that python 4suite is free - 
and maintained. Derek said fwiw 
i suppose in reports and such we could treat it like db drivers - 
where you can use your 'favorite' xslt engine. To me i think one 
issue with 4suite - is it is a REAL suite - i.e. its a LOT of 
junk we dont use, although it did have support for
a Python implementation of the 
ODMG 3.0 object database standard which Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) had been championing. Later, Nick reported 
I appear to have successfully created 
pysablot packages, in versions for both python 2.1 
and 2.2, which were now 

available for testing. There was much gratitude from 
various people.","2002-04-03","24"
"621","266","4","
The next day, Jason declared that Nick 
rocks because he created a pysablot 
deb for us :) He had done some testing and 
it appears to work. Nick 
said if you guys take on maintainership 
and clarify the license I'll upload itto debian. It 
would also need some documentation - 
there isn't so much as a readme in the tarball. 
Jason suggested who knows by the time 
we're done we might end up ""adopting"" a lot of small 
python projects, as a GNUe 
Python Orphanage. Daniel suggested 
GNUe Rehabilitation Center.","2002-04-03","24"
"622","267","1","James Thompson (jamest) said that one issue 
with the win32 patch on multilines that jcater pointed out in his (and 
my environments) we have both win32 and unix clients - if a win32 client 
saves cr/lf to the db and a unix client reads it and modifies it then we 
have a problem :) Harald Meyer (Harald1) said 
one just has to make a workaround, when things 
get saved into the database. He might 
take a look, but I'm not sure if I understand enough of forms. How is the 
transfer from GFObjects into the database done?. James said 
i'll try and find some time over the next few 
days as this is going to be  a pain in the rear - GFObjects never really 
hold anything - they pass it all to the data system -  even forms not 
connected to a database create dummy datasources to store their info - so 
the edits would probably need to go into common. He explained 
that the FieldDisplayHandler was new - 
while an edit is taking place the value of the field is passing into 
the handler - once the edit is completed then value is passed back to the 
entry which store it in the datasource. He had 
removed internal event name translation into 
lower case today and make a cool error - where the event handler events 
were not being seen -  so you go to a field , try and edit it (it'd go 
blank), then the old value would return on exit :) It hadn't 
taken very long to spot this error!","2002-04-04","24"
"623","267","2","He added my 
test case was calling lower something like 11700 times - removing it from 
the event system saved a few calls - however by writing the 
'force to lower-case' as an exception rather than the norm
in one function dropped that to about 1200 - 
profiling is good :). Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked whether 
James had used gprof for profiling. 
James said no - it's built into common's 
GBaseApp - forms, designer, reports, nav all based upon it 
and accepted a --profile option flag from the command line. He explained 
python has an internal profiler module. 
He didn't think it used gprof, as the profiler 
is written in python - and uses the way python works to hook into it - 
read the module manual profile section. Daniel wasn't so sure.","2002-04-04","24"

"625","269","1","Stefano Baronio (steu) asked whether geas 
is based on corba? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said that GNUe Application 
Server (GEAS) was being rewritten anyway, so it 
can use corba, soap, xml-rpc, other funky system. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) confirmed geas v1 uses corba yes. 
However, the new version will use gnue rpc - 
which is an rpc abstraction library - it will support XML-RPC, SOAP, CORBA 
probably right away - but its design is such that it can support any rpc 
that one wishes to write a driver for. Stefano said he was 
writing a generic system for distrib objects in 
corba, and I have found geas, but wasn't sure if it could help him. 
Derek said geas is not really distributed corba 
objects - i.e. our approach is to not lock ourselves into things - the idea 
is we use rpc as a transport only - not to actually deal with the 
objects. This was true of even the first, CORBA-only, version of 
GEAS - i.e. you defined objects via a class 
definition - that got loaded into GEAS but there was not individual IDL for 
every object. Stefano said my problem is 
not how to write a system like this, but how a medium developer can interoperate 
with it without knowledge of corba and c++. - for example, a VB or delphi 
developer. Derek said our view was that 
if you merely have an abstraction the developer really need not understand 
much of CORBA etc - as they have a lightweight CORBA api to deal with - 
instead of having to use CORBA to ineract with every object. 
Stefano said he needed a multi-platform solution that was quick to develop on.   
Derek said gnu enterpise doesnt have the goal 
of being a component company for vb/delphi (which it sounds like what you 
are looking for) - so i guess my short answer is that geas has little value 
in that context. However, there are 
plenty of folks that would discuss such things here as we discuss about 
anything.","2002-04-04","24"
"626","269","2","Later, Derek said there is some misnomer 
that i love delphi - i think some things in delphi are great adn i think 
borland builds much better tools than say m$ - but i dont think gnue should 
be delphi. Calum Morrell (drochaid) suggested that tools 
like kylix were better as free alternatives 
to Delphi as a generic rapid development tool.","2002-04-04","24"
"627","270","1","Rob Adamson (bobacus) said he had come 
across gnue on the web a couple of 
weeks ago, and it looks like an exciting development - particularly 
if it can replace MS Access :), as previously discussed in
.
Peter Sullivan (psu) said well, it's 
a bit more than that (or will be, anyway). However, 
the beauty of GNUe Forms as an Access 
replacement is that you get to use *your* choice of 
""real"" back end database - be it postgresql, 
SAP-DB, mysql, firebird or one of the non-free ""famous 
names"" DBs. Rob said he was installing the 
Debian packages. Peter said I'm not sure 
how ""solid"" the debs are at the moment. Nick 
Rusnov (nickr) warned the debs are being 
dropped from the distirbution I think because the latest ones are 
unbuildable. Peter felt It's a 
tad embaressing for a free software project (and a GNU project at 
that), but the ""easiest"" platform to install on at the 
moment is M$ Windows - just grab the setup.exe and go. 
He suggested I suspect you may be better 
installing from source on Debian GNU/Linux - I don't believe the 
dependancies are too awful to hack manually - and are reducing 
anyway ;-) Nick agreed - installing 
from CVS is very easy. Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) 
agreed - on debian get all dependencies 
from sid via apt and just get the cvs copy of gnue.","2002-04-05","24"
"628","270","2","Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) wonders why 
so many peoples do not like access that much?. Peter 
said that Microsoft Access was not a 'real' relational data base 
managment system, but it gets (ab)used 
for fairly big d/b jobs because most people on Win platforms have 
it as part of Office - and hence it is ""free"" (as in beer) 
to them. Rob said it does 
horrible locking stuff with its mdb files, which seems to interact 
badly with samba, afaict - but it can be used with other back-ends 
via ODBC.","2002-04-05","24"
"629","271","1","Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked should 
the different parts of GEAS be all running as separate threads 
in one python instance, or would you rather them be in separate 
instances, communicating via gnue-common libs?. Peter 
Sullivan (psu) suggested I would 
guess that GEAS should be as separated as possible as you might 
want to have it on multiple servers. Andrew felt that 
would make it more scalable, &
robust, imho. He noted webware 
has an appserver, i think we shoudl look at that for how they 
do object caching, etc. Peter said that 
scalability is important for 
GNUe, as no matter what we say, some 
people will use it as a Quicken/SAGE/M$Money clone on a single PC
[...] but at the other end you can replicate your GEAS servers as 
much as you like. Andrew suggested 
a node controller to provide 
functionality such as automagical 
failover, so that transactions aren't lost.","2002-04-06","24"

to run past an idea re: porting GNUe business objects to 
XSD - 
XML Schema Definition. Jason Cater (jcater)

for dtd. Ian said XML 
Schema is being used to replace DTD's, but that's only one 
use - Basically, you have an XSD (schema definition), which 
describes a complex structure, and then you have an XSI (Schema 
Instance) for each instance of said structure. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said our 
schema language should be ODL as that's the purpose of it, 
to describe the schema of an ODMS (which include object application 
servers). Ian said that, although 
ODL seems to make the most sense for 
internal definitions If you want GNUe to interface with .NET services, 
SOAP, etc, ODL is not going to do you much good....

if we leave it out we are better off - BUT people will whine if 
we dont - i think the right way to do it is allow custom .xsl files 
to apply ontop of standard - but that another debate. 
Jason said I have ONLY one reason for doing 
that - I don't like it - BUT - this is a demo in which I need PS and 
Text demos - and at the moment, I can't figure out tables :) - 
so if you have a ""width"" we can fudge it for the moment. 
Now, if you know how to draw tables w/o that information - I'm game - 
long run, that's what I'd like - and remember, this is a proof of 
concept markup, not necessarily ""official gnue"".
Derek suggested hard-coding a

you ahve done subtotals :) it will make me work. Jason asked 
how would you like it? we can change. 
Derek suggested XML source mark-up like 
<subtotalRow 
level=""2"">. Jason said 
actually, I think I prefer that.","2002-04-07","24"
"637","273","7","Derek did some more research on some 
xslt stuff - like attribute processing. He noted 
you can combine documents using 
attribute values to contain filenames, and 
we can do formulas in xslt if we so 
desire - hmm it can do sorting and the likes too. He 
reported well i have it respecting 
attributes :) - but its not pretty, as the table width 
of 100% makes it ugly. Jason 
suggested removing this - the table column 
widths are actual max character widths - which may or may not be 
relative in html output - but was mainly for text/ps.","2002-04-07","24"
"638","273","8","Nick reformatted the output using a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) 
to show how this would work. Derek looked 
at the version you made but struggling to implement it, but 
noted if i remove that 
text=""css/text"" works fine - prolly will choke the snot 
out of old browsers though. Nick said the stylesheet would 
normally be a seperate file. Derek suggested 
if you want want to pretty this up 
some, he might be able to get the 
xslt sheet to apply the formatting rather than have to use 
CSS. Nick noted you are getting logical 
information about the rows aren't you? [...] if you're getting that 
information, you can put it in class names - if its in class names 
you can mark up based on it. Jason agreed, 
as I don't wanna put css in the 
GNUe Report Definition (.grd) format.","2002-04-07","24"
"639","273","9","
After midnight, Nick suggested XML tagging like 
class=""total"". 
However, it doesn't matter what 
you call it on tehe grd side, as long as we can guess 
logical information about the data and convert it to CSS 
classes. For number formatting, 
what you should do is do like 
spreadsheets do it - and say 'this item should be numeric' 
etc - and then we can say at the HTML level 'numeric classed 
things are right aligned' Jason said he had been 
planning to have something like 
<field type=""date"" 
format=""y-m-d h:m:s.i"">2002-04-01 
00:00:00.00</field> -  and the XSLT could take it as 
provided - or if the locale preferred, could convert the 
format.","2002-04-07","24"
"640","273","10","Derek said technically
it might be preferred to make xslt do formatting. Nick 
agreed - I say remove all physical 
formatting from grd - only provide logical information for the 
formatting side to use as hints. But Derek did not 
want to lock us into xslt - 
so i woudl rather put the tag in grd and have our engine do 
it - though it think when we get cooking we probably wont have 
anything but xslt. Jason said fwiw, 
I don't want to put TOOO much processing off into the XSLT - as 
it isn't exactly known for its speed - i.e., transforms is one 
thing, sorting and format masks are another. Nick 
thought definitely do sorting and char 
level formatting on the grd side. but leave alignments and stuff 
up to the xslt based on type/class hints. Jason said 
there's several instances where I've 
needed right-aligned text- or left-aligned numbers - however, 
I do agree that the ""default"" could vary based on 
type.","2002-04-07","24"
"641","273","11","Jason went to bed, and Derek and Nick discussed using 
italics or sans-serif fonts, making more changes as they 
went. As more people joined the channel, Derek gave a quick 
summary of progress to date - the 
report is certainly lame but its really living and breathing
i.e. it actually gets its database from a database - 
you have an .grd which is xml that is like a form to define 
what db and such to connect too - then it goes out gets the 
data and makes an outputted xml file - and we do an xslt 
translation to turn it into html. He felt it was 
a pretty solid start.","2002-04-07","24"
"642","273","12","Derek and Nick continued to adjust the format to see 
what looked best. Derek explained 
subtotalling is not fully 
functional yet - jcater 
will probably have them workign tomorrow. He started 
to experiment with outputting newlines and tabs for plain 
ASCII output, and posted the 
start of a text version before going to bed - 
i just think jcater needs 
ascii output for some dot matrix forms at work - 
so wanted to encourage that it might be doable pretty 
quick, although he admitted 
it was easier to try txt 
as a second transformation than formatted 
objects for Postscript or PDF.","2002-04-07","24"
"643","273","13","After some sleep, Derek started on the Gnumeric 
format as well. He asked i 
thought that gnumeric saved in xml? [...] but default 
is some binary. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
said that the default was just 
compressed xml - via 
gzip. Derek decompressed it and exclaimed 
man is it 'verbose' - 
will have to do for loops with variables in xslt
get it to output.","2002-04-07","24"
"644","273","14","
The next day, Jason asked about progress on the text XSL. 
Derek said he was going to write some 
'functions' so col width="""" is respected - and would 
justify off that. Jason asked can 
I send you a sample of what I'd like to see?. Derek asked 
what do you want for 'pages' in the 
.txt version - will a 'form feed' char work?. Jason said
that will work. Jason said 
if you can get the text.xsl up to speed
then that'll free me up to make the datasources respect those 
passed parameters - this is gonna be one helluva 0.0.1 
release. Derek said we really 
need all the items released - forms, designer, reports etc - 
its been a while on all of them. Jason said 
hopefully this weekend or next 
week.","2002-04-07","24"
"645","273","15","Derek said that one of the downsides 
to GNUe - every time you need info you are your own best reference 
(according to google). Jason agreed - 
no kidding - I searched for xslt postscript 
yesterday - and guess what was at the top spot? gnue reports :) -
which blew me away.","2002-04-07","24"
"646","273","16","Jason posted a sample 
text
report, and asked btw, is there any way in 
XSLT to store arrays?. Derek said um
 not really - its morelike a functional language than a procedurual 
one. Jason recognised that, but was 
wondering if it'd be possible to remember the ""width"" settings 
for the <col> headings. He only 
had those in the <heading> section - it seems SO wasteful to have 
to repeat those for each row - but if that's all we can do, then that's 
all we can do :). Derek said you 
can have it persist.","2002-04-07","24"
"647","274","1","Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) suggested 
maybe it would be better to 
assign for i18n one directory - put there translations 
(maybe in subdirectories), some kind of readme what i18n is, 
in what ways it's going to be realised and etc.) - and that 
everyone could put his ideas/corrections there. 
Jason Cater (jcater) suggested the translations could go 
into /usr/local/gnue/etc/lang/ - 
or possibly etc/locale, to 
allow for localisations like time format as well - 
and maybe have subdirectories under 
that for each supported locale.","2002-04-09","24"

works.","2002-04-09","24"
"649","274","3","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) felt that 
documentation of what we are doing 
for all of i18n probably belongs in docbook/ -  with proposals

any tool-specific i18n files, so Jason suggested 
to continue w/our current model, they 
should all go into common/etc. This might not be ideal, 
but they could worry about cleaning up 
when we clean it ALL up :) Derek said 
let Arturas check it in so we can 
blame him later when people complain ;). Arturas didn't 
like the sound of that, but Jason reassured him 
don't worry.. we do that to derek ALL 
the time :).","2002-04-09","24"
"650","274","4","Arturas asked do we transalate 
error, debug messages? Jason thought error messages 
needed translating, but I wouldn't worry 
about debug messages at this point. James Thompson 
(jamest) thought i think the msg_blah 
stuff in gnue.conf needs to come out of there. Arturas 
agreed, as then there is no need 
to translate gnue.conf :) Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked 
does python support gettext?. 
Jason said it did, but unfortunately, 
we have to be careful in implementing that - as that adds a lot 
of overhead as it causes a python 
method call. James asked whether they could be 
cached once on startup and then the 
apps only reference the var that holds the output of the 
original _() call.","2002-04-09","24"
"651","274","5","Derek suggested that if its a 
message that is useful to teh END USER it shoudl be translated - 
if its more a 'developer' message - it should be in english 
only - as we already are assuming all 'developers' will speak 
english at least enough to code in english :). He said 
the problem i think lies in that 
our lower level debug statements - some of the stuff is actuall
'user messages' - but not all of it. Arturas agreed - 
all other strings (that end user 
can see) will be translated.","2002-04-09","24"

it is in python but you already know 
python, basically, if you know C++. He explained that, as 
python was interpreted rather than compiled, it  
has a library management system similar to 
perl's. But for most things
like simple scripts its just write and run. Justin 
said maybe perl has tainted my outlook... 
but scripts and I do not get along at all - he thought this 
might cause stability problems for something 
that will grow as large as GNUe will.... Nick said 
I see where perl would give you a bad impression 
of interpreted lanuages - Python is by nature object oriented - 
its not like perl umm package wise.","2002-04-09","24"

this ""you use whitespace for what!?"" then ""okay,

""I love python!"". Justin said 
he had just hit that ""You use 
whitespace for what?!?!?!"" phase. Nick said 
yea, thats the most painful phase of 
all - a lot of people get stuck there. 
Justin said also the lack of 
typesafety is troublesome too. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said that's what 
exceptions are for ;). Justin asked 
are braces optional?. 
Nick said you don't use braces at 
all. Daniel said python

how are you envisioning either mozilla 
or jabber working with business software?. 
Nick said I could see 
jabber for a distributed sort of business object network - you 
could use mozilla with a web-based forms client - but I don' 
see why it'dhave to be specificly mozilla. Justin 
said he would use mozilla for the XUL

b. as a integral part of the groupware/workflow components.
On Mozilla, i see someone could make 
an 'alternative' forms client with XUL model and java script

fixed font vs non fixed font issue - we can't just move to non fixed font and it 
totally screws up some forms. There was an option in the gnue.conf file to 
force fixed width fonts for a particular installation, however. Jason said that 
the problem was that, on many systems, including Microsoft Windows 98 and 
GNU/Linux, the wxDEFAULT font falls back to non-fixed 
width fonts He added what I *really* want to do

use the wxMODERN. He had had really bad luck

got the engine working and a command 
line version of it running - so ppl can develop reports and 
see what it's gonna be like, before the client/server

thinking the same thing could happen 
w/GEAS and Forms - that would allow ppl to start using the 
abstraction-qualities of geas - even before we get a 
solid/stable server/rpc setup. Derek was not convinced  
- unlike reports, geas is not 
usefull w/o client/server other than testing imho.

are considered ""public"" and which ones 
""private"", which made just reading the source

just wants docs that 1) don't require me to

extreme difficulty getting docbook to work reliably (on GNU/Linux),

standardizing on the XML docbook would be a 
positive move, as any XML transformation tool could be used to 
produce the documents. Texinfo was also suggested. James said 
texinfo and docbook have me spending time 
programming the docs - instead of programming GNUe. Nick 
suggested use a standardized text format, and 
I'll write a perl script to convert them to docbook :) but 
you don't really exploit the logical markup 
that way. James agreed - we really 
need chapters, sections, etc - IMHO - if there was any editor that let 
me easily write docbook - then I'm ok with docbook. Nick 
commented I coulda sworn abiword supported 
docbook. James said he wasn't a lyx zealot - 
lyx sucks too - it just sucks less than 
doing it by hand. Derek thought that 
99% of our docbook issues are that of 
staleness as they were still using the SGML version of docbook

are now xml and xsl there are 'issues'.","2002-04-11","25"

problem with the .txt docs is they are 
too incohesive and scattered and often conflicting so when someone 
tries to consolodate them and format them its nearly impossible w/o 
getting the original authors involved. He noted 
on at least 5 occassions i tried to 
consolidate geas docs to no avail. Jason felt 
one large doc is much worse than 5 targeted

for end-users becaues FINDING the docs 
is the problem - the idea originally was to have as many small docs 
as you want and then create books from them so users had a choice to 
search for a targeted doc or get a broader picture on a topic and 
garner all the docs for it. Nick suggested

"677","287","1","Jason Cater (jcater) said in the next week, we'll 
be doing the first release of Reports - plus a maintenance release of common, 
forms, and designer. Some of the commits you see are documentation for Common
so GEAS can get underway again. Neil Tiffin (neilt) was pleased that 
GNUe Application Server (GEAS) was being rewritten in python now, but 
its just sad that it will take a while to get back 
to working state Neil asked how to debug python. Jason 
said our GNUe-Common includes a 
built-in stepping debugger now - just run the app with 
--interactive-debugger. This had just been 
added in this past week :) - 
but james was showing me all it can do - and it 
rocks.","2002-04-13","25"
"678","288","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) said he had been helping someone by e-mail 
with installing gnue, all the time wondering why no-one else was 
chipping in, only to discover it was all going to his local LUG mailing 
list rather than gnue@gnu.org. They had now got it working, and he 
quoted some feedback received - Can't recall 
who recommended gnue for my simple invoice system, but thanks :-)
Took a couple days break from the install problems, and within a 
hour or two today, I have most of it working. This is neat stuff.
There were some problems using the master-detail wizard with MySQL, 
as the primary key for the master was an auto-increment field that 
didn't get created until commit time. Derek asked 
this is because he needs to use the 
spiff function? that doesnt exist for mysql? the get next id 
thing?. He suggested we might 
want to change the 'master/detail' wizard to allow this to be auto 
created (the function) as an option. Jason Cater (jcater) 
said that, in principle, auto-sequences 
are not a good thing in gnue-land but this was 
not a bad idea.","2002-04-13","25"
"679","289","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked about progress on the pysablot packages, as referred to in
.
Jason Cater (jcater) said I have them mirrored ,
as Nick Rusnov did not have an account on the gnuenterprise server. Jason
had looked into PySablot and the author is active -
he just started a new Python-related project on sourceforge this
month. Derek said he would rather that the original maintainer would
respond, but im pro adopting it if need
be.","2002-04-14","25"
"680","289","2","Later, Nick confirmed he was willing to 
maintain pysablot as an official Debian package 
if there is ubstream and docs and a copyright and a 
license. Derek said he believed license
is GPL and copyright is the fellow who wrote it. He had e-mailed 
the developer asking if he was going to 
continue its development - and if not would he turn it over to 
GNUe. He said i can probably whip 
together a license and copyright file for him and upload to him a new 
tar ball for release including at least a README ;) and maybe even a 
simple doc :). Nick said this would mean he 
could upload it to the archive as 
an official Debian package.","2002-04-14","25"
"681","290","1","Michael Dean (mdeanlt) asked how is reports 
going?. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) replied 
good - we are generating html now - 
and text (though poorly formatted). Output was currently 
to a static file, but its all using pysablot 
so we can do inline eventually. Already 
reports support output of file, email, printer, 
fax.","2002-04-14","25"
"682","290","2","
The next day, 
Talli Somekh (talli) asked i noticed that there's been 
quite a bit of activity with GNUe Reports in CVS the past few weeks - has it's 
status of proof of concept changed at all?. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
said the proof of concept works - if you take the 
foobulations report and run it, it reads teh database and creates resulting XML
and we have text and html transformations of that XML. Talli asked if 
it was production-ready. Derek said i would say if 
you have to be in production like today and you arent willing to 'suffer the 
ills' of using growing software then reports is not for you today - IF however
you have a little time before you need to be in produciton i.e. you are coding 
production and you have developers on staff that can quickly patch code if for 
some reason the reports development team is around - then reports might be a 
pretty good bet for you He added for 
immediate focus text and html will be the concentrated outputs - but i am 
looking at gnumeric and excell outputs as well - ps, pdf etc will come shortly 
but with XSLT they have to go to FO first which i need to study up on.
Talli asked whether creating new reports was 
a developer or end-user task. Derek said currently 
there is no visual report designer though we are expecting that our current 
visual forms designer will be easily adapted to the task. However, 
even at time of writing, if they know markup 
they can do it - i.e. if they could write an html report they could write 
a gnue report right now.","2002-04-14","25"
"683","290","3","On the postscript and PDF output, Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested 
someone will have to make a Python FO engine or 
else install java.. Derek said i am 
somewhat of an old skool postscript wizard - and im HIGHLY likely to instead 
go straight from XML to raw postscript as we have a python libary for 
postscript. Jason Cater (jcater) thought this 
would take ENTIRELY too long to write
Nick asked is FO really that complex? 
surely its mappable to TeX or something?","2002-04-14","25"
"684","290","4","Jason said that the html and text markups are 
quick little scripts dneighbo did, so writing 
other output formats will be trivial. Derek noted that 
with nickrs help most of that report for 
html has css (so any html person) could alter it without touching any 
real 'code' or xslt style sheets. Eventually, 
our designer will allow you to drag and drop 
to create reports - i will go out on a limb and say after we nail some basic 
reports and iron out some kinks that will be probably high on the list 
of next steps. For client/server access, 
fairly quickly we should support clients that
can talk some form of RPC (CORBA or XML-RPC etc) to talk to it.","2002-04-14","25"
"685","290","5","Jason confirmed that he had not implemented triggers in 
GNUe Reports yet - that'll be 0.0.2, 
but I feel I have enough to justify a first 
release. Talli felt well, a free reports 
app is certainly among the holy grails in the free software 
world. Nick said perl has EXCELLENT 
report generation stuff - that people rarely use - which is silly, 
cause thats what perl is FOR. Neither Derek nor Jason were 
keen on perl as a dependancy.","2002-04-14","25"
"686","290","6","For the column width tags, Derek was 
thinking it will be a lot easier to do 
width="""" on each tag like you had it before - but we can make the 
'designer' do the work - i.e. if in a header row you set a width it 
sets teh width for all its children. Jason said that was possible 
- just seems redundant. Derek clarified 
that you could use Reports without Designer - indeed, as of time of writing 
you had to - you could certainly use emacs 
or vi or anything that would let you edit flat text or xml. 
Talli said we've had many clients begging for 
reports, so this will certainly be something that will be on our 
radar.","2002-04-14","25"
"687","291","1","Derek Neighbors said that DCL (as set up for bug/feature tracking
on the GNU Enterprise project) sent e-mail updates to people who 
raised logs directly via their own DCL account, but not (as of time 
of writing) for logs raised via the e-mail gateway - 
thats somethign i want to 
add. Michael Dean (mdean) said 
that could be done, as long as the 
From: field matches the email in the personnel table. 
Derek, in the best recursive traditions of GNU, raised a 
work order on DCL for this functionality to be added to DCL. 
He asked btw: you have an issue 
if we maybe shut down the bug stuff on sourceforge for dcl
and route to the gnue version of dcl? He wanted 
to start showcasing the beauty 
of dcl :). Michael said he would 
have to go through it, but would be 
better to eat own dog food, I guess. Derek said that 
DCL was already rather usable 
when using it for software project 
(bugs features) like GNUe and 
with MINIMAL work i think we could 
overcome the issues.","2002-04-14","25"
"688","291","2","Later, Derek noted yummy dcl 
gateway has been patched - if you send email to it for support 
with the to: line being the same as what is your user account 
there - it will log it as submitted by your user account!.","2002-04-14","25"
"689","291","3","
The next day, 
Jason Cater (jcater) reported woohoo! I submitted my 
first DCL patch today. He had added ""Mailer: 
noreply-dcl@myhost.mydomain.com"" to his email headers -  so I can filter the 
damn things in his e-mail client. Since the 
From: is always the user's name and the To: is your name - there wasn't much 
to filter against - at one point, I was searching for [WO#.* in the subject 
but now that the GNU Enterprise project was using DCL as well, he couldn't 
distinguish between work orders from different DCL servers. Derek said 
i think here i hacked it to always send from a 
special account instead of from the 'user' - at some point might want to make that 
an option - as right now if i get a ticket and hit reply to all it probably emails 
the original ticket submitter - which in a lot of environments might be good 
as we really want the end users communicating with 
developers through DCL not individual email :).","2002-04-14","25"
"690","292","1","Bajusz Tamás (btami) asked how GNUe Reports would work
without x,y positioning - 
i'v used only fixed pos designers before. Jason Cater (jcater)
said I've used both - and in my experience, 
the fixed positions are a quick way to generate reports - but once you 
need more than they offer - you are kind of stuck. Peter Sullivan
said i have been anti-fixed positioning since 
before i used a report tool ;-0 - you have exactly the same problem with 
simple spreadsheet solutions - fundamentally, y-axis absolute pos breaks 
as soon as you get an extra row of data. Nick Rusnov agreed - 
at some point you have to say 'this goes here'
- but up till that point, imho, you should say 'this is that'. 
Jason said there are instances where physical
markup is a necessity - i.e., pre-printed forms - and i plan to allow 
for those. He thought those would 
probably be different designer wizards - we haven't actually done the 
designer part yet - but I'd imagine you'd pick from a few choices of 
""types"" of reports.","2002-04-14","25"
"691","293","1","Jason Cater said he had mirrored the new version of DCL to the gnuenterprise 
website - thought that'd be appropriate seeing as how 
he's gnue affiliated and all :). Derek Neighbors (dnWork) 
noted that the only issue with upgrading DCL was if 
you allowed uploaded attachments you will need to move those off some where
and then move them back - mdean suggests making the attachment directory 
outside the dcl tree so you dont have to toy with it for upgrades.","2002-04-14","25"
"692","294","1","It was asked what GNU Bayonne was. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) explained well 
for the enterprise it can be used to do voice mail - touch tone phone 
systems - like provide a menu. He wasn't sure about call 
forwarding. It basically provides telephony 
services like what some sophisticated phone system thingy does but with 
a PC and a telephony phone card.","2002-04-15","25"
"693","294","2","Later, Jason Cater (jcater) gave 
a link
to information about telephony cards, and confirmed 
bayonne can communicate directly with office 
PBX's - or it can take the place of a PBX - in which you have a complete 
call switching center on a linux box - you can use it for voice mail
(multiline) you could use it for interactive touch-tone menus - including 
tying back into a database (i.e., pulling up a client's account 
information via a phone menu) - ou could program autodialers (that work 
with a PBX or just on a plain old telephone line) - it's a pretty impressive 
piece of software. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he wasn't aware that 
Bayonne did Automatic Call Distribution.  Like 
call queues, and stuff.. Jason said I'm 
not sure how much out-of-the-box functionality it can do - it's really an 
architecture - imho, based on conversations 
with the bayonne guy - I don't know what it will do without a little 
coercing by a knowledgable staff.","2002-04-15","25"
"694","295","1","Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked 
anyone use ERDs? 
(Entity Relationship Diagrams). He asked 
why does ERD remind me of UML 
and relationships? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested 
because it maps directly to 
it?. He hoped that eventually GNUe Designer would 
allow you to basically 
design ERDs, select the database to dump the stuff into, then 
generate tables, and make forms and reports.
Daniel wondered why would you 
want to use ERD instead of UML? Andrew said
ERD is a special type of UML 
modelling, i think. Daniel dug up a quote that 
implied that Entity-Relationship and the Object Model were 
different approaches - ERD for 
2-tier people - and UML or something for objects that execute 
on the app server. Andrew thought that this 
means that it has to produce 
GCDs, and put them in the object repository. Daniel 
wasn't sure.","2002-04-16","25"
"695","295","2","Later, Daniel wondered if these 
2-tier guys even use ERDs - then probably just start making 
tables - no one bothers with design these days. 
Andrew asked whether you think there 
should be a standalone app that makes ERDs & then splats out 
crap via the schema api? or extend designer?. Daniel 
felt ERD isn't really for objects, 
imho unless and until they actually got implemented as SQL. 
However, sam thing could be said for 
ODMG's model  - they do data schema with ODL and functional with OQL
- but you can call methods. Andrew asked 
how we gonna do methods?. Daniel 
suggested very carefully ;) He 
suggested they would make a request - the 
methods server would look for the method - and load whatever it found 
at run-time - and execute it. Andrew suggested that 
we should use some of the DotGNU stuff 
here :).","2002-04-16","25"
"696","296","1","Jason Cater (jcater) asked about 
a gnumeric or such spreadsheet xslt script 
for our arsenal?. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he had 
started a gnumeric.xsl already - 
basically i formatted out in gnumeric what i thought report should 
look like and saved it - and dissected the xml to see. This 
produced very verbose output, but most 
of them are 'superflous' standard crap - so in essence i dont thing 
it will be tremendously difficult. For Microsoft Excel, 
its a little USED fact - but excel while
 it doesnt SAVE to xHTML has full support for it, so 
i planned on going xml ->xslt-> ms excel
xhtml.","2002-04-16","25"
"697","297","1","Further to 
, 
James Thompson (jamest_) noted the 
appserver dir in CVS and asked 
think we'll have a demo by say 
monday? Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that was perfectly 
possible, as long as the demo didn't actually have to do anything 
useful! Later, Neil Tiffin (neilt) noted hey, 
I saw some geas.py files going into cvs :). Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) suggested its bait - the 
question is are you big enough to keep or do we have to be good 
anglers and throw you back and hope you enlarge over the spring 
so we can catch you next year ;). Neil suggested 
throw me back - i'll be better next 
time. Derek said fwiw: i 
think reinhard is just throwing together some snippets to start 
'exploring'/'testing' and such.","2002-04-17","26"
"698","298","1","Further to 
,
James Thompson (jamest) proposed instead 
of putting gettext in each module couldn't we embed this in GBaseApp 
as a dictionary. This approach would mean 
at app startup gettext is called on every 
string required by the program - and the key:i18 string is stored in 
a dictionary - which we then reference from the code base - instead 
of doing the gettext call every time it's required in the code - 
function calls are expensive in python - dict lookups IIRC are 
not.","2002-04-18","26"
"699","298","2","Derek agreed - i would say at that point 
could we do is specific to the langaguage called - so say in my gnue.conf 
or whereever we get it i have 'ru' selected - basically reads the 
'default' and the 'ru' and merges them? This would allow the 
application to use translated messages where they were available, but 
automatically fall back to English where no translation was available 
(e.g. for developer-level error messages).","2002-04-18","26"
"700","298","3","To implement this, James suggested create 
a common Gi18n.py - import that into GBaseApp - have base app build global 
dict _translation - then when needed in module from gnue.common.GI18N 
import _translation or somethig like that. Jason Cater (jcater) 
pointed out that _ names are not exported - but 
I like the concept.","2002-04-18","26"
"701","299","1","Jan Ischebeck (jan) asked Is there an 
need of an RPC-status.txt ?  Do we allready have an GNUE RPC 
proposal? James Thompson (jamest) said 
we have functoinal (limited) 
code. Jan asked whether you 
like to have added simple GNURPC support to your first 
implementation of the appserver? 
Reinhard Müller said i think it's more 
or less a ""must have"" for an appserver. However, as of 
time of writing, the the 
toy code is more or less empty function headers - but it will be a 
proof of concept if it's possible to write an appserver in python - 
and maybe it points out a few things we have to regard in the future 
development process of the appserver. Jan agreed - 
I hope that adding GNURPC to the ""FIRST 
IMPLEMENTATION"" of GEAS 2.0 will help both the appserver and GNURPC 
because both parts needs each other.","2002-04-21","26"
"702","300","1","Jason Cater (jcater) asked have you 
heard of 
Nola?, 
which had now been released under the GNU Public License (GPL).
He needed a good accounting package - 
(free or otherwise). Derek Neighbors (derek) said he
was normally suspicious of proprietary software 
vendors suddenly making software GPL. Jason said it 
might just be that it's good, but the market 
has too many players - or only a few big players - so it's stuff ppl 
won't pay for - not saying that's the case here - but perfectly 
plausible. Derek agreed, saying i 
didnt investigate as the idea of web based accounting is just horrific 
to me.","2002-04-21","26"
"703","300","2","Jason said he was still TRYING to get 
something together for my accounting department - they are willing 
to go free - as long as it works and does what we need. 
He had considered just building a GNUe front-end to sql-ledger, 
but personally wasn't keen on it, having looked at the code. Daniel 
Baumann (chillywilly) asked don't 
we have an accouting package 
design? 
- just no code to imeplement said design. Jason said he planned 
to use GNUe in a few years - but I need a 
working system by June. Derek said 
louis' spec is darn good for two tier - 
like within a month someone could probably whip up a decent 
system - based on that spec.","2002-04-21","26"
"704","300","3","Jason downloaded and untarred nola, 
and worried about the use of copyrighted MS 
fonts and the US Postal Service's licensed zipcode data. 
However, it did look to have a realistic schema, with 
over 100 tables. He thought 
this nola might be exactly what I need as a 
basis, even though personally I still 
detest a web-based accounting package. Derek said 
actually if its good let me know - 
i will make screens :) using GNUe Forms.","2002-04-21","26"
"705","301","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) was having problems with the PRE-COMMIT
trigger in Forms. He was trying to use it to pass the primary 
key from the master table to the detail table, but 
it definitely is passing 
null's. He was also having problems with the 
PreCommit and PreInsert 
triggers, and autoFill still 
isnt release reasdy :) - though jamest swears it works for 
him. The documentation on triggers had just been 
updated a few weeks ago, so some of these latest triggers 
were still undocumented as of time of writing. Jason 
pointed out that triggers were not 
""supported"" prior to this next release - and most of the 
trigger code has been recently added, although 
we had ""triggers"" of some fashion 
or another the last few releases - but they were ""proof of 
concept"". He confirmed they were looking to do a 
new release of Forms soon - and 
designer and reports and common.","2002-04-24","27"
"706","302","1","Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked how 
does forms handle concurrency right now? like if 2 dudes were running 
the same form and modifying the same info? Jason Cater 
(jcater) said we would have the database lock 
the record being modified. In n-tier, where Forms was talking 
to the Application Server (GEAS) rather than directly to the database, 
it would be up to GEAS to do locking. Daniel agreed -
yea, geas should support an object locking 
mechanism like in the ""Object"" interface. He wondered 
what does the other guy see who doesn't 
lock the db? - he gets readonly values? Later, he added 
how much simultaneous access stuff have 
you guys tested? - do you get a phantom read? do you step on each 
others toes? what happes? Jason said 
it'd be a standard database error that gfclient 
would display - something like ""Unable to reserve record for update""
would popup on your screen. However, you should still be able 
to read the record if it's locked.
He explained forms will (when we finish it) try 
to lock the record on the first keystroke you make that would modify it - 
if it can't lock then it wouldn't let you modify the record and issue a 
warning. Daniel liked the sound of this.","2002-04-24","27"
"707","302","2","Earlier, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked what 
if the db driver is too crap to provide 
proper locking? Jason felt that if 
someone chooses to use a crappy database - well, then, that's their 
decision. Andrew asked is there 
a flatfile driver yet? Jason said no 
- but it's needed, adding I'd like to 
get one whipped up by the next-next release.","2002-04-24","27"
"708","302","3","Daniel suggest that database drivers should emulate behaviour 
like row-locking if the db does not support 
it. Jason couldn't see how that would work unless 
they are on the same machine running under the 
same session. Later, Daniel felt now 
theoretically shouldn't a db abstraction layer support all 
features and provide emulation for those that don't support things or do you 
go with the common denominator? where do you draw the line? 
Jason agreed - for the most part, it's a common 
denominator - but all dbms' should support a minimum of features - 
if not, then they should be renamed to a ""relational file system"" - 
and not a ""relational database"".","2002-04-24","27"
"709","303","1","Following on from , Nick Rusnov (nickr) said I have a few minutes to work on the packages for gnue now
- I was wondering what packages base depends on? or
recommends|suggests. Jason Cater (jcater) said that gnue-common was the effective ""base"" package - it
requires: python2.1,
python2.1-egenix-mxdatetime. He asked um,
what's the definition of ""suggests"" ? and ""recommends""? Nick
explained Suggests are things that it'd be nice to
have but doesn't need to be useful - recommends are things that are not
required to use it but make it much better - like recommends would be whdere
you put db drivers. Jason thought that python2.1-mysqldb and python2.1-psycopg should be in
recommends. Nick confirmed that GNUe Common could build correctly without them installed and still support them if
they are installed? Jason thought the egenix-mxdatetime dependancy
was more problematic, as datetime will be
""required"" for gnue-forms - but ""recommended"" for common - as I know forms
""needs"" it - but I guess you're right, common doesn't. Nick
suggested it can still depend on it without having
a build-depend on it. Jason said that gnue-common is a pure python play, so I don't think it ""needs""
anything but python to ""build"".","2002-04-26","27"
"710","303","2","Nick asked is there any way to prevent 
setup from installing etc/ into etc? I can't install the sample conf 
files into /etc if eventually there'll be a debconf wizard to set 
that up or something - I have to put them in examples/. 
Jason said not at the moment,
but maybe you need to tell us what you need 
to do it ""properly"". Nick suggested if 
setup stuck the etc/ stuff into etc/gnue/ I could just mv that 
down to usr/share/doc/gnue-common/examples/ - since you're using 
disttools it makes things really easy otherwise. As long as the prefix 
thing works correctly. Or if it didn't install etc at all that'd be 
easy too. He confirmed he was using python version 
2.1, snice that is the debian default I 
believe. or rather the 'official' version. Jason said 
it's a good ""safe"" version too - that's what 
we all do development with.","2002-04-26","27"
"711","303","3","Nick noted that it sticks everything in 
usr/local and asked do you like 
hardcode usr/local into it? Jason said 
that's settable - although everything is 
still relative to a base directory i.e., gnue/ - I can hack around 
that if this is really causing a problem. He asked 
how do you want it installed - and I'll 
see what I can do real quick. Nick said 
alll the python libs should go in 
usr/lib/python$VERSION/gnue/ - all the images and stuff should go in 
usr/share - the docs and such can go wherever, I'll just move 
them. Jason noted the first one we 
fought hard to stop our setup from doing - as that's a bad no-no. 
It was great, for debian :) but we are more 
than debian - that's where our issue comes from. Nick wasn't 
aure why - makeing it fhs under the prefix 
would solve a host of problems with me but shouldn't really cause any 
for other platforms. Jason suggested I'm 
thinking of having a site.cfg that the scripts need to know the location 
of but it would contain pointers to the other directories. 
Nick said he would then need to tell the debian packages where to look 
to find this file, but that should not be too bad. 
once this is solved, the rest is 
easy.","2002-04-26","27"
"712","303","4","Later, Jason asked do you have a 
build/install script or something that calls our setup.py? 
Nick explained from a makefile I call 
python2.1 setup.py build and then later on call install --root 
./debian/build --prefix '/'. Jason said he had amended 
the code so that in between the build 
and install parts a site_config.cfg file is created. If 
an external process such as the debian installer added path names 
to this file then the setup.py install 
(with a --cfg-path setting) will copy this file - and the tools 
will respect it. This gives you 
a way to make the tools respect any moves you do.","2002-04-26","27"

Python DB-SIG standard - we quickly found out that they all behave 
differently against the ""standard"" which is why we see these quirks 
- so while it's easy to say ""yeah, it's gnue's problem"" (which is 
partially is) we are the first app AFAIK to actually use all these 
""standardized"" database drivers side-by-side. He said 
as soon as I get a chance to test I'll see 
if I can find out the issues with those two drivers.","2002-04-26","27"
"714","304","2","Later, Bajusz suggested 
what do you think about a new lastrecord 
atrrib in the GDataObject ResultSet class ? maybe it would be a better 
workaround then owerriding the _loadNextRecord in many drivers.
Jason said there had been a reason why they had not done it that way, 
but he could not remember why. Bajusz explained 
then  _loadNextRecord would be called only 
when lastrecord=0 in first/last/next/prev/set record. Jason 
agreed - at first I was afraid of a performance 
hit - but that could be a performance gain. He would 
try to get to it tomorrow if I can.","2002-04-26","27"
"715","305","1","Christian Selig (sledge_) said he would like to get rid of 
the 'toolbar' in Designer. Derek Neighbors (derek) disagreed, but 
i do think its ok to make an option 
in gnue.conf. Jason said I don't 
necessarily like it either - but I want a complete UI plan before 
we do anything like that. Christopher said that the 
toolbar just provides a second 
functionally identical way of achieving something (in that case, 
changing certain values) which confuses users. Derek 
disagreed - its a matter of 
preference - its nice to have more than one way to do something - 
as long as all the way s do the same thning. I have NO problem 
making it optional - BUT to remove it will have 50% of the people 
asking why we dont have a toolbar. Nick Rusnov (nickr) 
felt menus are confusing - seriously, 
I don't understand why they are so widely adopted. 
Derek said i think OPTIONAL is the 
right answer -  as it give EVERYONE what they want - 
if you dont like the tool bar simply remove it via an option - 
hell if enough people are anti toolbar you could even make that 
the default.","2002-04-26","27"
"716","305","2","Christopher clarified that he wasn't referring to 
the toolbar which includes the little
icons!!!, but the thing which 
is beneath the actual form layout, letting you change name, x, y, 
w, h, which was referred to as a 'toolbar' in the source 
code. Derek said ah dood, you have me 
worked up over nothing :) - i fully agree with that one :)
Jason said I still want to make it OPTIONAL
as I rely on that - I HATE having to have a Property Editor up
just to change common attributes. Derek agreed, but said
it wouldnt be bad if you made say F11 or F12
toggle between the form and the property editor - as then you can have 
one on top and one on bottom. Christopher pointed out that 
a good drag&drop (think: delphi) 
would render that ToolBar useless and is way more intuitive.
Derek said you can do some of that 
now. Jason clarified that I have 
no intention of making major UI changes prior to a release and 
without a cohesive plan. Our UI was certainly hacked together
and it needs to be revamped but I don't want to hack away 
hacks. Most of the drag and drop functionality was 
already there, but wasn't very responsive, due to the use 
of wx - but the advantages we gain 
currently outway the disadvantages.","2002-04-26","27"
"717","306","1","Nick Rusnov (nickr) said that his Document Store proposal, 
as discussed in 
, 
was Pretty dead in the water - no demand, 
no assistance, no motivation. David McWherter (dtm) 
said he had found trivial document 
management project called 
Tavi - we 
integrated it into phpgw. But it's 
just for text and html - it does revisioning and stores in sql. 
Nick said he was thinking of 
restructurling his proposal to be more 
like a sort of immutable CVS of sorts - well not exactly - but something 
that more addresses my personal needs. However, 
I should lay out plans for an organic document 
system too.","2002-04-26","27"
"718","307","1","David McWherter (dtm) kicked off a discussion on 
basic DCL usage. 
Jeff Bailey confirmed he had produced a new debian package for 
DCL, waiting for woody to release.  I 
don't want it in woody.","2002-04-26","27"
"719","307","2","David pointed 
to his diagram of my impression of 
how dcl's static structure is organized - i welcome anyone to 
clarify or correct that impression. He explained 
the ""type of hierarchy"" is my 
improvisation - it's a little abstraction layer to help think 
about it - it may also serve in redesigning DCL to be more 
flexible. I would like to propose that we focus on those basic 
types of hierarchies.. in other words, create high level flows or 
whatever.  and then allow the configuration of arbitrary amounts 
of component hierarchies. In other words, to not have statically 
defined ""domain"" and ""project"" and ""WO"" concepts and to instead 
be more flexible for organizations who have higher levels of 
hierarchy, or finer grained hierarchy - like a corporate 
conglomerate with multiple business units - or for a workgroup 
that wants to use one DCL installation to manage their business 
and multiple related businesses and each of their personal 
lives.. Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked has 
the user interface been abstracted more? It seems ilke it was very ummm
crosslinked. David agreed - it 
feels sometimes like a labyrinth of concentric circles - it's not bad, 
especially coz there are always the high level menus available - i 
think it's done for convenience. it's a deep app. Nick said 
he would like easier interaction with the 
database in an abstract way - like so additional apps could be written 
as sort of frontends to it.","2002-04-26","27"
"720","307","3","Later, Jason looked at David's table, and said 
it looks ok to me - I do agree w/the 
defaulting - that's one of the oddities of dcl imho - in that, 
stuff that seems like it should default doesn't. 
David asked what do you think about 
the idea of redesigning DCL to not be static around its 
organization?  and to instead just have types of hierarchies 
which are arbitrarily configurable?:  do you dig? As a 
non-coder he wasn't sure if this was sensible, but 
all i know is that dcl doesn't 
scale organizationally Jason said his 
knee-jerk reaction says that it sounds 
great - but not sure how much recoding that'd take. 
David suggested that its current static 
structure should be the 'default' config for my proposed dynamic 
structure, but It'd be 
really, really cool if DCL could have sort of dynamic 
organizing like that. See, i want one dcl installation to serve 
multiple businesses, plus the personal lives of the individuals. 
So this would require that each person has their own products, 
departments, etc. phpgw has at least a concept of that, in terms 
of their ""global category"" - so maybe dcl could implement it 
literally as a ""global category"" from phpgwapi - or maybe that 
would require more fully porting dcl atop phpgwapi, rather that 
its current state of nestling within or next to it.","2002-04-26","27"
"721","307","4","Earlier, David asked 
does anyone here know if DCL 
domains create a separate namespace for usernames?  is there any ACL 
there, or is there one authentication base which can access all 
configured DCL domains? Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
and as far as security goes we would be 
better off for an infrastructure for all of GNUe. He 
thought Role Based Access Control 
(RBAC) looked nice - it's what SE Linux 
uses.","2002-04-26","27"
"722","307","5","David concluded that the discussion had been 
*tremendously* valuable for me as a

look at em and to not discount them.","2002-04-26","27"
"723","308","1","Matthew Emmett (memmett) asked is 
there a ""getting started"" guide or something similiar i could look 
at?  Derek Neighbors said its 
called this irc channel :) - get the snapshot or cvs - get the 
dependencies - and start going to town - ask here if you have 
questions :). As of time of writing, he suggested 
ignore application server and gcd 
files altogether for right now - GEASv1 is being replaced by 
GEASv2 - so for now i suggest avoiding it, if you are wanting 
production stuff - and look at doing 2 tier for now - and when 
new version of GEAS is ready then upgrade to it. 
Matthew said ok.. 
so i'll just make a db normally and then use forms and designer 
to access it 2 tier for now.","2002-04-28","27"
"724","309","1","Further to 
, 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) noted there 
is now a docbook channel here on openprojects - and the maintainer 
(nwalsh) resides there so if you have docbook problems in teh future 
probably a good place to seek help. Peter Sullivan (psu) 
asked would there be any point in 
converting our docbook-sgml docs to docbook-xml docs?
Nick Rusnov (nickr) felt xml is easier 
to work with. Derek thought there 
is benefit - i dont think it would be a 'ton' of work - as iirc sgml 
is more strict that xml - so there probably isnt a 'ton' of change to 
the source. Nick said its more strict 
in a different way. Derek said the down side of using Docbook 
XML is i do not believe the xml/xslt combo 
is working all the way - i believe things like PDF etc are still not 
working for Docbook, but are close. He 
needs to find a channel with 
xslt experts like Doug Tidwell or James Clark.","2002-04-28","27"
"725","309","2","He had had 
Simple 
Docbook recommended to him as an alternative to the full Docbook 
markup, which is 100% compatiable if you 
ever wanted to go out side of simple docbook. Nick said 
I was advocating a simple markup language 
that didn't use <> tags - like a extended plaintext format. 
Derek said he wouldnt be opposed to making 
a python converter i.e. so that one can write docs in simple text 
and then convert them. Nick advocated POD - the 
perl document format. Looking into Simple Docbook, Derek 
noted gack simple docbook has 106 elements - 
i was thinking more like under 50.","2002-04-28","27"
"726","309","3","Derek suggested i think i could take 
the list of elements in simple docbook - print them out - and go through 
and pare it down to a small subset we would actually use (probably about 
30) - and then that could be what we make supported for this pod format - 
and it would basically just convert a text file into docbook xml. 
However, this seems like such a waste 
though - why can not someone make a good doc tool?. Another 
option would be to get staroffice/abiword
to work i.e. if we defined 'styles' for those. Nick felt 
well writing an xslt thing to convert abiword
xml docs would be easy - abiword supports all the 'logical markup' we 
need - its just a pain to use it :). Derek said you could use 
xslt to convert back and forth from abiword XML to Docbook XML, 
but would have to abide by a certain 
stylesheet. He just doesnt want 
to spend time donig this sort of thing - it would be nice to have a 
cohesive doc solution though","2002-04-28","27"

any reason you dont wnat to use the

close to working again. He explained 
we hvae tried two different curses 
implemenations and are moving to our third - original was pyncurses

Jason warned that is no where near

are actually patching nstti to add more functionality to it

It was not far enough along to be 
worth filing bugs against yet. Derek suggested 
jamest: what would be nice is if you 
could flesh out the TODO's to get nstti working and file them as 
workorders in dcl - or if you can just jot them down in a txt file 
and email me - i will start a 'project' and create the work orders
so people can monitor progress. James Thompson (jamest)

code there to say this _might_ work. He explained 
we're having to fix up nstti as we go 
(in fact it's in cvs on www.gnuenterprise.org with authors 
permission). Derek said that 
is cool, but i imagine you have or will have a plan of attack - 
if you can get that to me in text file i can start some 'management' 
of it :), adding it as a product in DCL and

The next day, 
Gontran Zepeda (gontran) noted so 
pyncurses hasn't been maintained in over a year on sourceforge,

said the maintainer of pyncurses 
actually was doing gnue developemnt for a bit - he stopped doing 
gnue and pyncurses at same time - we were going to 'adopt' it, but 
then found native curses in python and switched to that. So we ahd
-u pytext and -u text for ui modes. Recently we have found nstti
which is better than both. It is unmaintained. We dopted it and 
its inour cvs tree. jamest almost has it working with forms - 
probably not this releasse but next. This would become 
the default text UI, however at 
anypoint someont could revive the pyncurses or native curses 
drivers.","2002-04-28","27"
"732","311","5","Gontran asked would 
there be any, ahem, strategic advantage to either pyncurses 
or the native drivers?. Derek said 
well pyncurses lacked to much - 
and was a dependency and not maintained - native was good 
(no dependency) but had very limited functionality - nstti 
was WAY more advanced so it is less work to maintain it
and add what we need. However, 
we certainly would not prevent 
anyone and would encourage anyone to write the drivers for 
pyncurses and/or native - as choices are good :) - though 
admittedly it woudl seem like a waste of time.","2002-04-28","27"
"733","312","1","David McWherter (dtm) asked does gnue 
intend to become a RAD environment?. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said it is already - 
it does not want to be Delphi, powerbuilder, VisualBasic - 
it wants to be a Business RAD tool. David clarified 
what i meant to say was, does gnue 
intend to be a RAD for newbies, like LAMP (the generic 
term for using Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP - 
you know, basically throwing 
something together quick and dirty but stable.)? 
He was trying to envision phpgw's 
long term relationship toward gnue. Derek said his 
view was that GNUe Tools are RBAD = 
Rapid Business Application Development tools - geared as much towards 
:business/system analysts: as programmers. i.e. if you can understand 
teh structure model of your data and can define what 'rules' you want
you should be able to make applications in GNUe w/o beign a hard core 
programmer - much the way our analysts today can open up Excel, do some 
spiff work sheet functions, maybe even make some macros adn do some pretty 
cool stuff - but if you asked them to 'program' something they might 
laugh at you.","2002-04-28","27"

sashxb as an alternative to GNUe, he 
added GNUe's power is not ONLY in fact 
that its xplatform, XML based UI - we are starting to see these in 
droves - its REAL power is its data handling - fact i can make a 
master detail form that is xplatform in under 5 minutes - and all 
databinding is handled - no SQL no anything. He noted 
most of these other tools dont even 
think about making widgets talk to a database - much less complex 
stuff. for us data aware isnt 
an 'afterthought' it wsa the REASON to write GNUe - so why we dont 
have all the whiz bang pretty widgets to say write and ftp client -

writing groupware with gnue? 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said you 
define GROUPWARE much differently than mdean and myself - to us 
groupware is a server thing not a client thing - i.e. we would 
expect it to be no problem for someone to extend say evolution, 
phpgw etc to use new items in gnue groupware - we do NOT plan 
on making clients - though forms and geas would be able to hook 
into the serices just like anyone else's clients. 
He noted that there are 
some prexisting specifications like iCalendar,vCard, LDAP and such that 
if we reused properly could be used by existing clients almost 
untouched - on other pieces we would make the service and pick client 
of choice and implement there or convince them its good for them to 
implement. He noted that a contact 
application (CRM) is not groupware :) per se, but 
groupware services would make it 
BETTER. He would be keen to extend the current PHP Groupware 
cliets if possible - the point is not to 
make clients from scratch :) - too many exist and we are busy 
:).","2002-04-28","27"

to be a php-based RAD 2) mdean severely doubts or discounts its 
robustness, and he knows it well 3) other people do take it seriously 
although i'm not sure if they fully understand it, but for example 
savannah.gnu.org wants to port all their services atop phpgwapi. 
Derek felt that to me GROUPWARE is not 
something you use to build savannah :) - imho GROUPWARE should not be a 
RAD - it should be services. However,

Ideally, he wanted to write 
it once in some main, basic file, that is imported in EVERY

using the library that is in debian? He thought it would be 
good if the basic GNUe system only had dependancies that were in the 
common distributions, such as Debian woody (3.0) and RedHat 7.7. 
Jan said there was an alternative XMLRPC library that was available 
in Debian woody and which was under the GPL (GNU Public License) and 
was faster, but which was more difficult to set up - 
the client is working ok,  but the server 
is a bit difficult. He noted the 
orignal server from the py-xmlrpc package (the one in debian)

(dneighbo) confirmed that forms opened in entry mode by default, 
but you could run a query using f8 and f9. He explained 
ok the way it works is we have inline 
query building - so if you hit F8 then go fill out data in your 
fields then hit F9 it does a select that uses those values in the 
where clause. He confirmed there 
is a way in the datasource to make it AUTO query at start up -  in 
the datasource tag you put prequery="""" - HOWEVER i think its broken 
right now in cvs (or was a few days ago). Forms could cope 
with large numbers of records as we 
have cache="""" which tells how many records to keep in memory - 
i think the default is like 5. He suggested 
you play iwth the 'prep query' F8 and 
'exec query' F9 - you can do some cool stuff - you can use the tool 
bar buttons as well or menu items you arent forced to use the F 
keys. Matthew asked do the

He had expected that if he put conditions on both the 
Master part of the form and the Detail, that both conditions would 
be applied. However, what it did was 
query just the entire detail table (regardless of master) - is that 
what is 'expected' ?. Jason Cater (jcater) said

it used to give you an ERROR if you 
querired by ddetail - not an error but a message saying 'thats not

might be a barrier to the use of GNUe Financials in Germany.","2002-04-29","27"
"747","318","2","
The next day, Reinhard Müller (reinhard) commented 
i am 100% positive after finishing 
the financial module we will find someone who approves it in 
germany very quickly. He said if 
we find only say 20 companies wanting to use GNUe accounting in 
germany and dividing the costs among them it would be doable.
That was how free software works 
imho","2002-04-29","27"
"748","318","3","Previously, in response to questions about architetcture, 
project plans and timelines, Daniel said 
well their used to be architecture 
guides but they are old - forms has a
technical reference and 
user guide - geas is being reworked and 
a draft architecture giude is in cvs. Derek Neighbors
(dneighbo) said there were 6 or 
so core folks doing development 
but as of late i think we have 
nearly 40 people that have copright assignment that can or have 
contributed on some level - i believe we have several hundred 
folks following the mailing lists and such - and certainly more 
nameless ones that keep in touch via 
GNUe KC.","2002-04-29","27"
"749","318","4","Derek said we will have GNUe 
Workflow eventually, its not a current focus however. 
He explained that the first version of the GNUe Application Server 
(GEAS) was being re-written - basically its 
middleware - in the sense that it provides rpc communication to 
clients - and allows business logic to sit on it - instead of in 
the client or as triggers/stored procs in the db. It will also quite 
likely offer relational to object mappings. There was also 
much work going on developing GNU-RPC (GNUe Common).","2002-04-29","27"
"750","319","1","Further to , Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) pointed to a  diagram of common
for chillywilly. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said all we really need is to embed some comments/docs into
the code and we can have ourselves api documentation that can be
generated. He didn't like the fact that
in gnurpc we call the various rcp methods 'Interfaces' - we should call them
transports or something like that and an interface would be the exposed
methods, imho. However, it would be confusing to change this
now.","2002-04-29","27"
"751","319","2","
After midnight, Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) asked why is 
there always a proxy object involved? Jason Cater 
(jcater) replied to proxy the 
requests - however, this might not be necessary 
with object-orientated transports - 
in corba's case, I think it'd 
handle the proxying for us but he wasn't sure.
Daniel asked why GNUe Common supported a
connection to 
a unix domain socket and a tcp/ip socket at the same 
time? Jason said a 
socket file is faster, iirc - but you have to be on the 
same machine. It was not 
a big deal providing either option. The 
parameters for a TCP/IP connection would be the host name 
and port number. The ansychat module it used was not 
standard python - it's part of 
medusa - which we may bring into our cvs tree (if licensing 
permits). This was also what 
Zope and Webware used. 
Jason explained that code like 
__name__ = '__main__' 
could be used to test whether a module was being run 
directly from the command line 
or whether it was being called from within another module. 
Daniel thought this was a nice 
way to add text code for your module. Jason agreed, 
but said there were other uses too.","2002-04-29","27"
"752","319","3","Later that day, Gontran Zepeda (gontran) posted 
a semi-beautified 
common.dia. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said cool. 
I want to have a poster of it and noted 
hey jcater: there is even an 
bakery on it ;)","2002-04-29","27"
"753","319","4","Later, Daniel asked about this 
call() method in the xmlrpc driver. Jason explained 
gnurpc supports objects whether 
the underlying transport does or not. xmlrpc does not - 
so when an object is being used the server creates the object, 
but the client creates a proxy of that object (this is the 
client code in gnurpc, not the actual client app). So when 
a method is called against an object a string representing 
that object is passed back and forth via the transport 
(xmlrpc). In general, he felt there was 
not much to it in GNU-RPC
(GNUe Common) - just basically a 
few methods to say, ""what methods do you expose"" - you're 
gonna know more about gnurpc than I here shortly :)","2002-04-29","27"
"754","320","1","Reinhard asked about using CamelCase (""HumpBack"") or under_scores
in function names. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said that, as a Java 
convert, he tended to use CamelCase but 
i think both ways are ok. its just important to be 
consistent. Reinhard said that the GNU standard was 
under_scores, but the code for GNUe Forms and Common used CamelCase. 
Derek 
Neighbors (dneighbo) said in code 
camel case i think is preferred - in table definitions _ is 
preferred. Jan noted that under_scores used
one byte more in the code than 
doFoo (bar, baz).... so the real performance freaks ;) use the 
last one. James Thompson (jamest) suggested that, in that 
case, 1 letter function names 
rock! Derek suggested since 
common, forms, reports, designer are written - rather than go 
and and change - lets use what they do, although he 
was not certain what that 
is. Reinhard asked about spacing before a function 
name or between parameters. Derek said he didn't think 
consistancy here was essential the 
important part is the name - as that is what will be 
'referenced'. Reinhard agreed - 
iAmHappyWithEverythingYouWant.","2002-03-31","27"
"755","321","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked what 
is a .grpc file? He was just 
nervous that specs are being made w/o any formal review. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said it was a 
description of an RPC connection. (in XML). This was 
not a replacement for a .gcd (GNUe Class Definition). 
Jason Cater (jcater) explained it 
defines what methods we want exposed, so each ""Server"" app will 
have a grpc file - yeah, like the old geas.idl files - only 
generalized. It would not be different for each provider - 
geas would have ONE grpc file - 
and gfrom that we can generate corba stubs or equivalent 
for the RPC protocol in use. He had used .grpc as the file 
extension, as I was afraid gr? would 
be confused/conflict with reports stuff but 
none of this is set in stone. 
Derek clarified that im not opposed 
to greater than 3 car extensions - Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) noted this is not DOS 
;).","2002-03-31","27"
"756","321","2","Jan noted that many 
protocolls (like xmlrpc f.e.)  won't even need an  .grpc  
file, but its good to have one to control access on the server 
side. It might also be possible to 
Add an lokal socket implementation, 
which allows any kind of RPC methods, and which writes a 
communication protocoll into a GRPC file. with this tool it is 
possible to change your application, or write a new application, 
then use the special protokoll one time and voila get a GRPC file 
for normal protocolls.","2002-03-31","27"
"757","321","3","Derek said my concern was if we 
were to have lots of these - it woudl be worth renaming. 
Jason said well, honestly, I foresee 
GNUe having a total of maybe 3 of these files - one for geas, 
one for integrator, one for report server. Derek agreed. 
Jason added well depending on how we 
do other stuff (Authenticaion Server, Workflow Server, etc)
I suppose there could be more than 3 - but you get the point
i.e., these are NOT a replacement for GCD.","2002-03-31","27"
"758","322","1","It was asked if there were any reference sites for GNU 
Enterprise. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that 
dneighbo, jcater and jamest use GNUe 
Forms, Reports and Designer in production for projects they are 
involved in. It was noted that GNUe had been considered 
for a project to replace a Microsoft Access database, but the 
designers had eventually gone with phpgroupware instead, as 
web-based access was a priority. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo), remembering 

noted that gnue right now is PRIME 
for replacing access applications - i.e. i think that would be the 
#1 use as it sits today.","2002-05-01","28"
"759","322","2","He said the 'need web' is 
interesting - although thin client might be a 
requirement, he didn't think that typical web 
browsers such as Mozilla or Internet Explorer were particularly 
""thin,"" and if you are making people 
use lynx for a production application i pity your users :). 
He admitted the correct answer is 
mozilla,i.e. might be thick thin clients - BUT in our case they 
are already on the machine.","2002-05-01","28"
"760","322","3","Derek admitted that they had not pushed the web interface for 
GNUe, saying there is phpclient in cvs 
now (iirc) - also a webware one (though it might not be in cvs). 
However, the core GNUe developers were not personally that 
interested in web applications - we 
fully want gnue to support them but were leaving the coding 
effort in this area to others. They personally tended to use other 
thin-client solutions such as LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project). 
Gontran Zepeda (gontran) quoted somone from another channel who 
had said heterogenous os environs 
demand a web-based solution. Derek disagreed strongly - 
GNUe clients could run on any 
O/S that there is a browser for.","2002-05-01","28"
"761","322","4","Concern was expressed about having to install a GNUe 
Forms client on a large number of distributed desktops. Gontran 
suggested create a nice installer?. 
Derek said the only time i see web 
app having a real advantage is if you have LOTS of clients you are 
not in any control of i.e. CLASSIC web applications. 
But in practice, most companies would not want standard ERP 
functions such as inventory, financials 
etc shared by the masses of the internet - most of those applications 
are behind firewalls.","2002-05-01","28"
"762","322","5","Derek said the negatives to web-based applications were that 
a. the widgets are not conduvice to high 
volume entry/validation - b. statelessness sucks :). However, 
he recognised that its EXTREMELY important 
for gnue to have a webclient :) for use where it was appropriate. 
James Thompson (jamest) said that GNUe's web clients would not use java -
they would be server side for now 
with the browser only on the client 
side. Derek pointed out btw: an applet is 
not a web application - as you have to download .java files to your 
computer - so your argument of 'distribution' to lots of users over the 
world is then lost - as every time you upgrade they will have to redownload 
applet etc.... (iirc). However, it was felt that a java 
download was fairly painless for the end-user.","2002-05-01","28"
"763","322","6","Derek noted with geas i think we can have 
something similar to applets - you download (via good installer) the 
client - and have it point back to a GEAS server - and you are off 
to the races.","2002-05-01","28"
"764","323","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) reported a bug running 
GNUe Designer - NameError: 
global name '_' is not defined. He wondered 
if this was because it can't 
find the messages for gettext. He was 
installing CVS in his own directory, not as root. Jason Cater 
(jcater) wasn't having the same problem, but 
I bet he has a locale setting
whereas I don't - so mine is falling back to the dummy 
_. He asked did you run 
./setup-cvs.py - or the individual ./setup.py scripts in 
each tool?. Marcos said he had 
run setup-cvs.py, but it doesn't 
install designer.. Jason said it should. Looking 
at the source, he spotted a bug 
in setup-cvs.py, which he fixed and then asked 
Anyone running CVS copy of tools:
Please update your CVS checkout, do a rm -f ~/gnue/translations,
and then rerun setup-cvs.py. He said
StyXman: btw, this may not solve 
your problem - but then again it may :). Marcos 
said that Designer was generating a warning 

'Unable to load locale information falling back to dummy 
_()' - but it loaded... Jason explained 
I didn't actually change anything 
in there -  but the way it was - each time you ran 
./setup-cvs.py, it would create another level of ""translations""
i.e., after 4 runs you'd have 
translations/translations/translations/translations/.","2002-05-02","28"
"765","323","2","Marcos asked what's _() used 
for?. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) explained 
when you have string in English
it shows, that this string has translations. 
Marcos asked from Desugner.py, 
I realize that it can handle several instances. I think 
an instance is like the representation and handler of a 
form? Jason explained well,
technically, it's an instance of a designer object - with 
FormsInstances being the only currently implemented type - 
but we'll also have report instances, biz rules instances, 
etc.","2002-05-02","28"
"766","324","1","Further to 
, 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said nickr: 
i want to get you moving on docustore if you are still interested.
Nick Rusnov (nickr) said he had layed out a 
good schema for it on a recent trip. Derek said 
i am seeing a need for us internally to 
have a way to manage our documentation - it is out of hand right now - 
so why not eat our own doggie food. He said the 
project needed a nice web interface 
(or forms interface) to our documentation - so it can be stored 
'physically' all over the server (if so desired) - but have a 
unified way to get at it. He was 
really thinking of trying to make it like a library in a sense - i.e. 
categorized, searchable etc etc - and then i started thinking hey 
wait some of this stuff is the same thing a lawyer or doctor or xxx 
might need to get at their 'documents' - maybe i should be thinking 
about document management here. This was without 
even getting into versioning and 
such.","2002-05-02","28"
"767","324","2","Nick said his current plan was to allow 
youto store a notional docgument as a 
URL/md5 sum or thhe actual data. He would 
do a dia of the schema I havwe in 
mind. Derek said even a 
database that does meta data and just stores a url would be a huge 
win :). Nick said the metadatabase 
and actual storage thing are pretty independent - and so is the 
libarary which is a layer on top of metadatabase. I'll start laying 
out the metadatabase componant when I get the chance. Its actually 
kind of neat - you recall before that I had a fixed sort of 
versiniong relationship? I changed that so there are 'relationship 
objects' which define various classes of relationships between 
documents - eg version-of, derivative-of, etc - each would be well 
defined so you could track the genaelogy of a particular document  
these rel/ationships could also provide heuristics for inheriting 
metadata.","2002-05-02","28"
"768","325","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked for a quick summary of 
if i have a database and i want 
to read data out of it what do i have to do? (using common of 
course). James Thompson (jamest) said 
first you have to initialize a 
datasource - this will require setting a few vars in a datasource 
instance then calling it's initialize function IIRC. You'll also 
need to create a connection manager - and tell the datasource to 
use it (this gives you connection pooling). Reinhard 
asked where can i see the instance 
vars of datasource?. James thought 
probably the best place to look is 
in GDataSource.py - look at 
the bottom of the file in the xmlElements - the attributes are 
the things that can be set from an xml file. ","2002-05-02","28"
"769","325","2","He said if this is for geas2 and if we 
use xml files to define the datasources
then you don't really need to worry 
much about this - as the xml parser does the right thing. 
Reinhard said geas will define the 
datasources dynamically i think -  
_if_ we use xml files - i don't 
think the parsing of the file will be at the same time as the 
creation of the datasource object in memory.He would 
expect it to work like this: client 
requests an object from appserver - appserver checks if class name 
is valid (needs xml definition for that) - if valid then appserver 
translates classname into table name - then appserver creates 
datasource object and fetches the data. This would need 
some translation between the xml 
definitions (= object definitions) and the database access 
(= table definitions). He explained 
the ideas is that appserver shows 
an object oriented interface to the client - most important 
translation here is namespace - i.e. we will have ""modules"" 
with own namespace - to avoid naming conflicts between parts of 
the application created by different people. In the 
actual database, all tables of a 
module will be prefixed by the module name in the db 
table.","2002-05-02","28"
"770","325","3","James could see where you are 
going - you're not wanting to tie up memory with unused 
datasources. Reinhard agreed, saying 
i think a final gnue install 
could have some 100 tables, and sometimes there 
would need to be multiple datasources pointing at the same 
table, for example 2 users 
access the same table at the same time.","2002-05-02","28"
"771","325","4","Reinhard said actually 
another reason is that i want appserver to be very modular - 
i.e. to separate the object repository (where the objects are 
defined) from the database access part. 
Jan Ischebeck (sledge_) asked how to link 
two tables (master/detail)
at the appserver level. 
Reinhard said that we have 
objectlists - objects - and every object has fields - a 
field can be a text or a number - or another 
objectlist. Jan asked if a field could also be 
a tree? (in the more general 
sense of the word). Reinhard said it could be 
even more a web - you can 
have customer.orders -> returns a list of all orders of 
this customer and at the same time have order.customer 
-> returns a single object, the customer of 
_this_ order.","2002-05-02","28"
"772","325","5","James said i need to study 
geas more but most of what you require is _almost_ in common - 
objects have custom namespaces, executable code can be attached 
to events etc, - however most if it is based upon idea that the 
parser builds the initial structure of the app - so we'll have 
to make some adjustments in common to do it differently. 
He had started working on making 
common more general now. He explained 
the parser builds an inverted tree 
of app objects - then the GClientApp system callings a 
phasedInitialization system that lets each object set itself 
up - the datasystem makes just such an assumption - as there 
is no clean API to set this up outside the parse. 
Jason Cater (jcater) pointed out that 
Objects can be created/added to a 
parser tree without GParser - just look at designer/Incubator. 
James agreed, but is it 
clean?.","2002-05-02","28"
"773","325","6","Reinhard asked what was next after getting the datasource. 
James said you use it to create 
resultSets - which contain recordSets - which contains your 
data. He said you should 
be able to call createResultSet - if you pass it a condition 
tree from GConditions then that'll alter the query to match what 
you require, and gave some pointers to examples of how 
it was used in Forms and Reports.","2002-05-02","28"

had not finished my draft architecture 
document yet. However, there's 
some inital code - reinhard added some to fit his API. 
He added I htink jan added support for 
GNURPC to geas - but I think that api will change - or at least 
someone will have to take into consideration what I am doing at some 
point. He suggested any interested parties should check 
out his document at /docbook/Proposals/geasarch/outline.txt - 
mainly working on defining the Python 
ODMG binding which should go into common. Jan Ischebeck 
(siesel) was working on the link between GNU-RPC (GNUe Common) and 
the Application Server, and arturas is 
doing i18n. Christian Selig (sledge_) felt that 
i18n should wait before major production

catch up with the primary language is a nasty issue.","2002-05-02","28"

Two days later, Jan said I've 
read odmg.txt, but its some time ago. outline.txt is informative, 
except of the overview at the beginning, it is mostly about odmg and 
how to describe objects, or how to map  ODL into python objects.
I think two other things are also very important at the moment:
a) object-relational mapping (you said it) - 
b) more concret definition of the way to access objects. 
Daniel said well the client API is 
defined in ODMG, imho - it just needs to be worked out.","2002-05-02","28"
"776","326","3","Daniel explained that the Application server would need 
metaobjects - objects about objects - 
so you can change the schema on the fly. Eventually,

generated. Jan was impressed -

Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said he was 
keen on ODMG as well, however i feel a 
strong urge to only implement what's needed. Jan asked 
whether this was just to get working code sooner, or for 
performance issues. Reinhard said 
his motto was ""something is perfect not

like views in postgres. You define an object which is an wrapper for 
the real object, but which only allows read access for 
example. This would mean everybody gets 
access permission to that new object (the view) and just root has 
access privilige for the other one.","2002-05-02","28"

we will add that before the next release -

I hit jcater up about mxDateTime when he shows up. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said he hadn't 
considered it before. James suggested checking 
only if it's something all gnue 
apps depend upon - like the python check - as reports doesn't 
need wx to live - but the db driver system dies w/o mxdatetime. 
I almost think this should be part of the installer - 
and the developer setup shouldn't need it. Course that implies 
we need to release - so that people aren't forced to cvs :). 
Derek said i think the developer 
setup should have it all - as it INSTALLS all packages. 
He added i do agree about release 
so that we dont have people using cvs install.","2002-05-03","28"

Unable to load locale information falling 
back to default English language translations. James said 
that's fine - basically you haven't 
set an localization - or our system doesn't know your localization - 
that is very much a work in progress. However, Forms was 
not loading. Jason suggested running it with 
--debug-level 10. Tihomir 
pasted the debug messages, and Derek concluded 
ok - so we still have wx problem. 
He felt we really need to retrace all 
your steps - and systematically uninstall all you have done relating 
to wx* - so we have clean slate. As best i can tell it looks like its 
installed just not quite correctly - i.e. its out there under 
python2.2. He suggested can i get 
you to uninstall the rpm for wxPython which had come with 
the Mandrake distribution and try 
this one
instead directly from SourceForge? This proved to solve the 
problem, and the sample form finally loaded.","2002-05-03","28"

said I don't think GEAS is totally 
defined...I see nowhere where a object-relational mapping is 
specified (yet) ;) Jan said it

common/dbdrivers and appserver can be connected.","2002-05-04","28"

The next day, Jan said he had made 
some changes to setup-cvs.py and asked for comments. he 
said there is still one problem with the 
gtestcvs command now. You have to be into common/src/commdrivers/_test 
to test the rpc server. So if it doesn't work, you know why.
He also noted dbdriver/popy introspection 
support is broken. I have a ""bit"" dirty fix, and am not shure if i 
should commit it, as my patch is 
dirty, because I patch it in the _pqsql directory and not in the popy 
code itself.. James Thompson (jamest_) said 
what we've typically done is copy the 
non-std function from _pqsql into the driver and patch there. 
Jan said this could be done, I've just 
been too lasy.. He confirmed server.py 
is fixed. now the whole test case should work.
GTest.py outputs a menu and you can choose 
which testcase you like to run (f.e. donut rpc test client, test 
server, geasRpcClient, or the appserver/test.","2002-05-04","28"
"791","329","3","Jan also asked about quoting of table 
and row identifiers? To my knowledge this is not  done at the moment.
James said we probably should. Jan 
said he like to include spaces in table and field names for improved
readability. James wondered if all db's 
support that? - mysql<cough>. Jan said he would expect 
that every db use a different quoteing style. 
so there should be a function ""quote_identifier"" in GDataobjects which 
can be overwritten by the drivers code. James suggested putting 
it in _dbsig.","2002-05-04","28"

cool if you could fix it :).","2002-05-04","28"

most of our objects have the 
same name as the module? - this 
is because we have a source file per class, right? Jason 
Cater (jcater) said not necessarily - 
but there was enough code for Datasources to justify their own 
module. We don't have strict rules governing what's in a module - 
other than neither of us like 1000+ line files. 
He explained a module is either - 
1) a directory with an __init__.py file or 2) a .py file. 
Reinhard noted that and 1) consists 
of a lot of 2)'s ?. He concluded

Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested check 
out cvs and run setup-cvs.py - it will install things in /home/username/ 
for you. Nicholas said Ok.  Now just a matter 
of figuring out the db setup and trying some of the samples. Thanks..
Daniel noted btw, I think there's going to be 
a new release soon ;). Nicholas felt 
Isn't every cvs commit a new release? ;). 
Daniel said in the sense that there should be 
better and more upt to date documentation ;) - and it will be an officially 
supported version ;) - not that you can't get support here though :). 
Nicholas thought that documentation was certainly 
worthy of a release. I was trying to figure if some of the stuff at 
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/docs/ was really ""Updated: 14 Jul 00"". 
Daniel noted the Forms API will be in the new 
technical reference ;) - instead of having to grok it form examples, 
etc.. Nicholas suggested a nice

Another thing you guys should setup is a CPAN like place 
where outside developers can contrib applications so others can see what can 
be done. Daniel said I am not too familiar 
with CPAN but we plan to have an arhcive of packages built with the tools -

Three days later, Peter Sullivan (psu) asked if there was

seperate hyperlinks that pointed to the same place. 
He asked what are our working

Perry Lorier (Isomer) suggested user 
someone that doesn't know python - developer someone that 
wishes they didn't know python. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said all internal

section, but there isn't much right
now of that.","2002-05-04","28"

the developers one says coming someday :) - the idea was 'developer' 
documentation belonged in one place and user documentation in another - 
at this point i would say we have very little 'user' documentation - 
and even then its not 100% crystal clear - as we have 'development' 
tools - so should the docs on how to use the development tools be user 
or developer docs :)? He would like to 
see documentation by product - so say there is a FORMS documentation 
page - and a DESIGNER documentation page etc - and then in each one of 
those pages there is developer and end user sections - same for the 
packages - but then there is global doc page - that shows all developer 
or end user.","2002-05-04","28"
"798","330","5","He felt the biggest problem was we wont 
standardize on doing docs a single way. He said 
the original idea was to have compendiums 
built - i.e. books built off the smaller documents - so one could say 
i want every document from gnue - and get a fat old pdf file. 
Peter wasn't sure this was necessary. Derek said 
it gets asked for ALL the time - 
most people dont like going all over the world trying to get information 
(our current state is REALLY bad) and downloading lots of little tidbits 
of information - especially those that like to kill trees and read 
later. He felt if you do indexing 
properly and chapters correctly - when it rolls up - its still relatively 
easy to find things. In a typical IRC topic drift, the 
conversation then mutated to the similarities between accountancy

Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) summed up previous discussions from

only because it has nasty dependencies or something. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said it needed non-free software, notably 
Oracle. 
Daniel said we support Oracle - 
but we also support a LOT more ;). Robert Dean (rdean) 
confirmed that Compiere's wesbite mentioned 
they're working on pgsql support, 
later adding that the oracle specificity 
is derived from using Oracle extensions to SQL. 
Andrew noted compiere also requires 
jdk 1.4 from sun :), which was not free software either. 
On licensing, Andrew noted that the 
compiere public license is

do even/odd before 1.0?, with odd numbers for ""stable"" releases.

i18n changes. James didn't think would be an issue - 
the i18n is cake to disable for a release - 
just modify GBaseApp to always call the dummy _(). Jason said
this was what he was worried about - don't 
know what exceptions, if thens, etc, have a _() that we haven't had code 
run against :). Derek picked up on James' statement that
gnue.conf isnt needed? James said 
testing today shows it is - but it should 
not be as the system now has all 
defaults in a .py file - that can be overridden by gnue.conf. When time 
permits I'll make the new config system write config files too - it's real 
close to that today - then our installer can create them on the fly
if needed. Derek thought this sounds 
dangerous to me as he did not think 
defaults belong in a py file.","2002-05-05","28"
"803","332","4","Derek proposed from now on if we go into 
a segment where we are getting ready for release we branch the code - 
so things like rewriting the conf system and doing i18n and such 
are in the branch and we dont have to 'wait' to do releases - as this is 
always what kills us - is 'features' not fixes keep getting added in the 
last push for a release - this is why we need roadmap more clearly defined - 
so we can say xyz will be in next release - anything not xyz goes in a 
branch. Jason said the distinction between ""feature"" and ""fix"" 
was often murky, citing the conf system 
changes as an example. Derek agreed - i 
realize a lot is dictated by 'need' - but i think if we kept a version 
branch to help us stay focused it would help - but wouldnt prevent people 
from adding stuff that was 100% necessity. He noted 
btw: this is the same issue debian woody is 
having so its not a direct criticism per say - there may not be a good 
answer.","2002-05-05","28"

The next day, James asked where 
are we at wrt to release? Jason said 
well, the biggies iirc were gconfig

implies better documentation. James said

available packages/templates for GNUe. Peter Sullivan (psu)

a redesign in the works. He explained 
at the moment, the tools are pretty much 
all we have (Forms, Reports, etc) - if by ""package"" you mean Financials, 
HR, Payroll, SCM etc - then all of those are stalled at the moment - some 
we have proposals for, some we don;t. The sticking point has been 
that although we *could* write packages using two-tier - ie forms talking 
direct to database - we don;t really want to - we really want to use n-tier - 
ie forms talks to appserver talks to database. The project had 
ju7st started an appserver re-write - 
once that is bearing fruit - we can start on the packages for real. 
In the meantime, 2 tier (forms to database) is *very* usable for people 
who want to write their own apps, noting 
several of the guys here use Forms in 
production.","2002-05-05","28"

project seemed like my best bet ;). Peter confimed 
we live & breathe python here -

other benefit of hopping onto GNUe now is that if you write an app in 
2-tier (i.e. forms talks to d/b) - once the appserver is ready to rumble - 
moving to 3-tier (forms talks to appserver talks to d/b) should be an easy 
conversion - basically take all your triggers and business logic out of 
forms - and put it into appserver. This might even be possible to 
automate.","2002-05-05","28"

complexity - we're here already. Alexander said 
I was looking for something that I could 
customize the hell out of... And shrink-wrapped isn't my kind of style.
Peter said We like customisation - 
as GNUe packages will be GPL, nothing to stop you re-writing source. But

£50 fingerprint detector. I know sklein is the main player on security 
issues - but he rarely shows up in IRC - he obviously has a life 
;-). He felt biometrics are a 
possible solution to a real problem - in that some orgs have a culture 
of password sharing - which can't be allowed if you are going to make the 
best use of ERP - becuase you have to be able to depend on login being 
who they say they are. Calum said that many people used easily 
guessable passwords. Peter felt things like 
LDAP & single log-in can make things worse - as people don;t think 
thru - that giving your secretary your p/w to print off that word file
also gives her access to the requistion screen in Purchasr Order

just follow the rules to freedom - GPL compatiable is more tough as it 
requires something to be more copyleft and any thing that 'demands' 
acknowledgement or has odd verbiage is usually tossed - i.e. many a

the appserver test program you have to set up pgsql so that 
your unix username is known to postgres and you need no password 
for your username as of time of writing. Andrew Mitchell 
(ajmitch) suggested that it should 
pick it up from gnue.conf?
or is it connections.conf that it should be in? Reinhard 
was not sure if that is a good idea.
He said we actually need to decide what 
user the appserver will use to connect to the database. 
When a user logged into the Application Server, 
should the appserver log into the db 
using that user's username, or a generic login such as 
geas?","2002-05-07","28"
"829","342","2","Andrew asked so where should 
the password be stored? the appserver will need to be able to access 
it to connect. Reinhard noted it was one of the principles 
of the 3-tier setup that 
security must be handeled by appserver 
not by database. This meant that the Application Server 
""user"" on the database needed a very 
secret password. Andrew jokingly suggested 
i know! we can build in an ""override"" 
password so it can be used in the movies! :) 
Reinhard suggested i see only one 
chance - store the password in a file where only the user ""gnue"" 
has read access - and start the appserver with suid flag. 
Andrew said that may work - but how 
do we start the appserver with suid flag since it's a python 
app? Reinhard said it might be necessary to 
write a ""wrapper"" binary? - 
one that exec's appserver.py and dies 
immediately (so it doesn't use resources all the time). 
However, he wondered if the file 
with the password in it should be referenced from 
connections.conf.","2002-05-07","28"

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) emphasised that

in the dependencies section i 
think we should be mirroring binaries of current dependencies 
of gnue so say rpm's or .exe's for wxPython/wxGTK, python, etc

all over to get stuff imho. I think i made stuff under my home 
dir for python2.1 and redhat that had most of the rpms - 
we really need to do it for others as well. Peter

that the boilerplate for that directory could assume all s/w was 
free (for reasons you state) but not necess GPL.

He noted that docbook is used by many

docbook is GNUe's official format - but we dont FORCE people to use 
it - we want documentation, so we arent too picky. He had 
used happydoc, but i agree with reinhard 
i dont want our docs all in the source code - i would like to see methods 
and such have one line descriptions - that would be pulled by happy doc - 
so the 'skeleton' of the API can be autodocumented - and then someone 
can add 'filler'. Reinhard said i 
would consider this ""dangerous"" - because it tempts you to document the 
api from the code side view - instead of the user side view - 
however if the documentation is good i wouldn't mind how it 
was started.","2002-05-08","29"

a good way to shoehorn new developers into

that he was a big advocate of docbook as a format -  
so a docbook friendly abiword would go a 
long way toward wooing me back to docbook - the only thing I don't want

it be worth doing the first version of geas while TOTALLY ignoring objects 
altogether? They could just get the 
rpc and remote methods working? i.e. bringing us n-tier with minimal fuss

Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said i 
think we could as a first step implement appserver with 1:1 
object-table mapping - and then add more and more oop features as 
development goes on. He would 
write up a summary for whitepaper what 
oop features i think we will see in appserver. 
Derek expanded im thinking geas 
for first pass uses datamodel of forms(common) entirely 
and doesnt try to make it into objects - 
maybe to teh point where the concepts of 'gcds' dont exist or 
are limited - rather instead its just triggers. He 
emphasised that this was just for 
the first pass (not long term). He felt 
someday i would love object to 
relational mapper with an onslaught of features - 
but realistically there is huge value in remote triggers via rpc 
today and thats a much more obtainable task - however, if it 
means doing one way we can never get to the other i dont think 
that is necessarily good - and why i asked for opinion on 
it.","2002-05-08","29"

The next day, 
Gontran reported he had got 
my papers, posting the both (gnue, and nstti) today to 
FSF. He asked about the history of nstti. Derek said 
i think jamest found it and liked 
it - he contacted the maintainer who basically said he wasnt really 
using it anymore so wasnt maintaining - jamest felt it was better 
than what existed - so him and the maintainer agreed it would be ok 
for us to put in our cvs tree and alter it - i think the idea is that 
if we start to alter it that we will just 'adopt' it - and it will be 
pretty much GNUe Curses (under the nstti name) or such. 
Gontran noted that it only used the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL), 
not the full GPL. Derek said the problem 
is that we dont put things in our tree w/o assignment - so its in our 
off tree. However, there has been 
talk amongst us of whether its worth getting assignment from original 
authors - at which point it would be come official gnue. 
He added the issue there was current 
maintainer isnt current author - so its kind of been handed from person 
to person without good record - which is why i preach that REGARDLESS of 
what license a project is under if you contribute code to it make sure it 
has its copyright in order or you could learn lessons the hardway

approach nicely because we ask for the copyright so we dont have the 
hodgepodge, but we dont want to restrict the contributor from 
his own work so we leave full copyright with them as well.","2002-05-08","29"

have a definition, a python class for that object, and correspondgin meta objects

Derek already has some ""simple"" Forms 
that point at DCL tables. DCL was not 
just a bug tracking system. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) confirmed this - 
DCL is coming form the other perspective
- it is more a project management/help desk tool - 
than a bug tracker. I'm trying to add some more 'bugtracking' features 
to it - as i think free software projects need both 
management/helpdesk/bug tracking. The main weakness at 
the moment was how it handles contacts and 
hierarchies - much of which is painful in lack of RBAC. 
However we have started to make the contact 
portion more robust - tackling some organizaitonal hierarchy issues in 
the process - i think once those are in place that RBAC can be implemented 
fairly quickly. He said we use it more 
than anything because it has a gracious maintainer who shares our vision -

something comparable). Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said

middle tier enables you to seperate the biz logic from the Forms. 
He gave an example - a basic rule of accountancy 
is that journals must balance. In two-tier, 
you would have a trigger on the journal form submit 
button to validate and print a ""add it up, bozo"" error msg - In three-tier, the 
validation would be done by the middle tier & would sned the error msg back 
to the forms client. Daniel explained that the Application Server was

GNUe allows you to store your forms on HTTP doesn't 
it? Perry Lorier (Isomer) said that way you 
could update the HTTP server and suddenly they're all updated :). 
Later, Daniel cut & pasted the code which allowed you to 
have http://my.webserver/form.gfd as your 
location for a form, noting this 
is used throughout whenever a Forms definition was referenced. Peter 
said that The other claimed benefit of 3-tier is 
that you can have ""thin clients"" - but this is fairly notional as even

what make an 'object' different than a 'business 
object' anyway?. Jan agreed - for me object 
can be anything, while business objects are objects to store and calculates data 
directly needed by the application.. Daniel felt 
but either way you have to define them right? 
He said GEAS needed langauge to describe the schema of 
our objects (GCD, ODL, etc.)...those do not constitute the object itself...in fact 
we can get picky and say that an object is an ""instance"" of a python class (which is 
generated from the description). Jan said he had thought 
to make as much as possible of the building blocks of the 
application server objects in the application server as 
I think there is no way to create a python class in a 
programm (without dirty tricks), so I though of an geasMetaObject which holds the 
class definition and can build instances. Daniel agreed - 
there's going to be a whole meta object api for adding 
types on the fly the way I see it - but one could also just parse 
GNUe Class Definitions (gcds) or go from the current

<field name=""Date"" 
value=""December 25, 2001""/> rather than 
<value>myvalue</value>, 
which would be easier to work with. He cut & pasted 
his very basic .grd file, 
but this was generating an error. Jason pointed out that 
you have no section tag. 
On fixing this, Derek did a happy 
dance its making the file - now if mail merge works im in 
bidness. Jason said well, it 
won't initially - because you changed the field tag - but 
should be a quick fix :).","2002-05-13","29"
"865","359","3","Derek noted that merge-rtf 
merge-latex and mailmerge.py are not executable out of cvs 
as of time of writing, and asked for this to be fixed. Jason 
said he was setting it up so you can do
grcvs -d myfile.rtf --filter mytemplate.rtf  myreport.grd
to execute the whole process.","2002-05-13","29"
"866","359","4","Jason wondered should this actually be called 
mailmerge? that's what I'm so used to calling it but is that appropriate 
here? Derek said honestly its for 
more than 'mailing' - but i think mail/merge is the industry term. 
Jason said it's more of a templated document 
merge - but that is long :) James Thompson (jamest) suggested 
docMusher(tm).","2002-05-13","29"
"867","359","5","Derek was still having problems with the 
way mailmerge.py parses things and asked for a patch. Jason 
was jealous - I'm not sure - as if you get this 
working - you will be the first w/reports in production - and that just 
isn't fair :). Derek said well 
techincally its for a demo - but i can bet if the demo goes well it wont 
be long till production and feature creep. Jason had a look 
at the code, as did Derek, who asked how 
are you normally keeping track of the parent? Jason said 
he had no test report to test with at the moment. Derek asked 
is master/detail in reports 
working? Jason said it should be - 
but haven't tested much - last time I tested, they did :).
James asked dneighbo: you making notes for 
a users guide/tutorial? Derek said more 
than likely i will make this a real example - since it IS going off of 
dcl. He noted btw: the grd with custom 
name space is pretty powerful db to xml tool. Jason agreed - 
yes - it's the start of GNUe Integrator :)
Derek said yeah it just needs its better half - 
xml to db :).","2002-05-13","29"
"868","359","6","Later, Jason confirmed I committed my changes... 
grcvs supports mailmerging as it sits now. After some hassle, 
Derek got the changes and noted he didnt address 
how i had hoped - he did it the proper way - not the quick way - will have 
to tackle tomorrow :(. Later, Jason said that, to run the new 
version, you needed to add an entry in 
report-filters.conf - (there is an example there) - then run as 
grcvs -D file -d myoutput.rtf --filter myfilter.rtf myreport.grd. 
Derek said i like it all cept having to make 
the entry for the file but this is in the right direction. Jason 
said the alternate is to either put the file in 
your shared/filters/MailMerge directory (or a symlink) - it's not ideal, 
certainly - but I am sans-a-pretty-solution.","2002-05-13","29"
"869","359","7","Later, Derek cut & pasted his error message. Jason asked 
lemme see your grd file. Derek 
put it 
on 
the web. Jason realised that, as it was 
standard dcl tables then
I can test this puppy too :). 
Derek said you just need the rtf file - 
or create your own. Derek found the problem - 
the XML output had an ampersand in some text that wasn't being 
replaced by &amp;. Jason said I 
thought I was using encode() for those - lemme look. 
He found the problem, and fixed it, saying 
btw, I consider this my 0.0.1 RC1 
:).","2002-05-13","29"
"870","359","8","Derek ran the report sucessfully, but both Abiword and 
Microsoft Word were fairly slow opening the output rtf file - 
open office didnt bitch though. 
James said ooooo man - if this plays w/ 
openoffice - and if we get the label sizes - i can use this....um, 
yesterday. Jason said well, I have no 
idea if I'm creating valid RTF - if we have any RTF experts in the house, 
please look. He pointed to a 
utility that would let you print RTF from 
command line, iirc. He added these merge 
examples support embedded images too :) - I tested that out with my 
marketing campaign. Derek finally got the ouput to open 
in OpenOffice, but reported it appears to 
be same record over and over - 327 pages. He would look at this 
further tomorrow.","2002-05-13","29"
"871","359","9","
The next day, Derek (laurie) said i 
think the rtf page break is not working correctly - when i created 
that output.rtf - on windows the first page is almost correct and every 
subsequent page is paged incorrectly but every page has correct data 
starting at SR 1 and going through - on openoffice in linux the paging 
is also out of sync. Jason said it's 
gonna take some tweaking w/the rtf but 
there's some changes in CVS, although 
he wasn't sure whether they would be in the automatic nightly CVS tarball 
posted to 
the website. Derek said well i have 
heard before that mfs does wild rtf (not quite standard) so this could be 
part of issue to perhaps? He felt by 
the time we get this working - it will be like 0.5 state :). 
Jason asked if that meant it'll be half 
useful?","2002-05-13","29"
"872","359","10","Later, Derek (dneighbo) said he was going 
to play with master/detail in the grd i think - and then will play with 
parameters - so i only print one of these things at a time :) - nulling 
the need for paging :) - at least temporarily. Jason said 
I find the rtf format thoroughly confusing - so 
I'm still trying to figure out just which tag is the table tag :). 
Derek reported we have case sensitive issues 
in datasources again i think - but Reports was using the same 
code in GNUe Common as Forms, which wasn't having a problem. Jason 
said I'm sure it's an initialization problem. 
Derek confirmed ok its definitely a reports 
issue, as he copied the datasources from a working GNUe Forms 
Definition file into a GNUe Reports Definition file 
and get the same error.","2002-05-13","29"
"873","359","11","After a while, he asked how 
can you use params as query options? Jason cut & pasted 
an example, using an <eq> tag for 'equals'. He explained 
you HAVE to pass parameters on the command 
line at the moment. Derek asked if there was a tag for 
'like' (pattern matching) as well as 'equals.' Jason said 
lemme look, warning 
btw, you are getting into untested waters, 
right now - just be forewarned - the code is there - but isn't heavily 
tested. He confirmed yeah, I think 
there;s a <like>, adding for 
an idea of what's supported, look at common/src/GConditions.py - at 
the bottom of that file is a dictionary of supported tags.","2002-05-13","29"
"874","359","12","Jason did a one-character patch(!) to the code, and Derek 
reported kick ass params work - 
i think this will over come my paging issues for now - 
since i will only be generating one sr at a time. He 
said only thing outstanding i think 
to make this work with DCL 
is a. getting master/detail working 
- b. making php call the reports via 'exec'. Jason said
I'm doing b. right now :) - well, indirectly
- if you want my script, I can send it to you - it's a little 
specialized to my setup though. James suggested 
have your php exec an ssh which commands 
reports to dump to stdout -  then you can put reports on a debian 
box - wonder if that'd hurt responce time much :) Jason said
his set up was, if anything even more complicated - 
you should see what I'm doing w/my Zope 
setup :). He had my zope server talking 
to Oracle on my solaris machine w/no problem - however, I want to let out 
sales reps download the actual reports we print for them - so I've hacked 
Oracle Reports to spit out PDF to a file (thank you ghostscript!) - so I 
have apache+php running on the reports server - which exec's oracle's 
runrep - zope calls this php server - to retrieve the pdf reports - and 
sends them on their merry way. Derek said 
im hoping php has an exec that waits until 
completion - as in my case i will have dcl call a page that passes the 
sr_number - execute the report and create the rtf. When exec is done - php 
checks file exists - if it does it merely opens the rtf otherwise it 
errors - or something SIMPLE - as i want a different solution long term 
this is the 8 hour fix.","2002-05-13","29"
"875","359","13","Later, Jason said if you can whip me up 
a master/detail test report - I can debug it tonight. He would 
also see if he could hack datemasks if you 
want to be beta tester for them. Derek said this was 
not huge item, master detail much more 
important.","2002-05-13","29"
"876","360","1","Derek Neighbors (laurie) noted that forms 
isnt particularly bitchy about data typev - you can set datatypes in the 
entry tags so that it will validate against that type in entry - and

confirmed usage). However, geas

that's how detail datasources work in

the name of the field in the master 
table in the XML, but 
if i leave that i bitches thats not 
a valid field - if i change it a valid field in the detail table

about have my reports ready for demo, although it was not 
really production quality as of time of writing. He had found
that php exec/system calls are pretty 
freaking weak wrt: debugging - but now i at least have a SIMPLE script 
where if you hand it WO/SR number it prints my form :) He 
asked Jason Cater were you able to fix 
master/detail in reports - it would be more impressive for demo 
tomorrow but not mandatory :) Jason said he would
try to look at tonight - I'm sure it's 
not a big fix - as it was working. Derek said one of the 
problems he had had was using the file extension for Forms 
rather than Reports out of 
habit and php had not given him a sensible error 
message.","2002-05-16","30"

have dcl using gnue reports as of um - 30 seconds ago. He 
had been able to rather easily hack 
in to a dcl workorder template to make it call report engine. 
He said that his employers might be willing to be a DCL/Reports 
reference site. David McWherter (dtm) suggested

like it - and most wanted to switch now - which is highly promising even if we 
lose.","2002-05-16","30"
"883","363","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked what the 
short name for the ""object server"" in neilt's 
drawing 
was. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) referred to 

gnue/docbook/Proposals/geasarch/neilt-arch-explanation.txt, and 
suggested GNUe Object Access Translator 
(GOAT)?. He noted the documentation said 
This is the main part of the Application 
Server. GOAT uses GEDI and GEMA to fulfill requests directed at business 
objects, after it has checked the validity of the request against 
GEOR.","2002-05-18","30"
"884","363","2","Jan noted that neilt want's a ""object 
server"" who has MVC (modell view controller) capabilities. I don't know 
exactly if this is compatible with standart transaction and locking 
schemes. (like the ones in an ODBMS) . He thought 
there is the need to make more agreements 
about the kind of ""application server"" we want to implement. Everytime 
beginning with a new component for my ""_featuretest"" approach, I'm quite 
unsure if someone agrees with my thoughts.","2002-05-18","30"
"885","363","3","He asked whether real ""objects"" will exists 
in any stage of the appserver or does GOAT just simulates objects out of a 
combination of data stored in sql DB tables and methods provided by 
GEMA?. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) explained 
my plan was to not have python objects - 
although it seems as it could be easy so it'd be cool to have - 
but primarly we will have objects that are accessed through the defined 
api (via geasInstance). Jan asked But 
if you create geasInstance for each table row. why not directly creates 
an real python object which inherites geasInstance? Reinhard 
said if it's easy then we will do it - 
however other languages are not as flexible as python in creating new 
classes dynamically - and eventually we will have other language bindings 
than python for geas. This would mean 
the geasInstance way will still exist, 
since the dynamic class will be on client side 
imho - i.e. the geasInstance will go through the rpc module - and be 
converted to a e.g. customer object at _client_ side. Jan 
agreed that this could make the programming of 
the database adapter easier and it will work with every programming language. 
But there should be an option to have direct access on the objects. (which 
is really easy to implement in python), giving an example. 
Reinhard said that looks good and sane - 
however do you agree that this would be client-side (RPC wise) ?
Jan thought that the trigger code wants to use 
this feature too, so it would be better to implement it ""server-side"" - An 
other possibilty is to write the code once and use it for triggers at the 
server side and for ""getAttribut1"" Access at client side. 
Reinhard thought this was better.","2002-05-18","30"
"886","363","4","
The next day, Reinhard asked Jan
whether his latest commits meant that 
forms work with geasv2??
Jan confimed this but just read only. 
and without conditions as of time of writing. Jan 
asked for specifications for reading 
informations about a table, like supported fields, ...  and a 
specification what kind of arguments are passed to setConditions 
:) Reinhard suggested define 
pseudo-objects - so we can use the same interface to get that 
information as we use to get real data. He agreed about 
setConditions.","2002-05-18","30"
"887","364","1","Jan said he had comitted to CVS a 
gnue/appserver/src/_featuretest file, which was an attempt 
to implement some ideas from odmg.txt and an book 
about object servers.. He explained the 
idea of _featuretest is to have a kind of ""object server"" which
is very very simple, but which has objects to implement the rest of
the server funtionality. Because this objects are objects of the objects
server they can be updated and reloaded on a running system, and the most
important: they can be stored and loaded from a database. I.e. you can
store session states, class definitions, normal objects with the same
code. Jens Müller (ICJ) said I 
understand 
the trigger stuff better now. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
suggested discussing it further the next day.","2002-05-18","30"

about doing a basic Application Server first, with full 
object support later. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) was worried that this would then 
require another revamp to support

take to agree the object standards to be used in getting a 
full object-based Application Server up and 
running. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said that, if everyone 
was happy to use the ODMG standards, 
there are no debates, 
imho.","2002-05-18","30"

i still believe that is like saying 
let's drop apples and only do fruit - dbabstraction + triggers

he was suggesting for a first pass was 
no need for a GNUe 
Class Definition (gcd) file. Reinhard asked 
where will we define what methods 
exist and where they are stored in that 
case?","2002-05-18","30"

like a more general approach.. Daniel asked 
and the long-term one would be based on 
what?.","2002-05-18","30"

The next day, Jan asked do 
you think that appserver v.0.1 allready needs Object/ClassDefinitions?

layer?. Reinhard said we have to 
do a roadmap, suggesting:","2002-05-18","30"
"892","365","5","This would make 0.1 as the first version that 
really makes sense to use - with only basic fields (string, number, boolean, 
datetime) - then in 0.2 0.3 0.4 etc we add features like reference fields, list 
fields, indirect fields, calculated fields, triggers. Jan suggested 
doing reference fields = 0.3 for example. 
Reinhard said i'm not quite sure about when to 
implement namespaces and especially on how to implement them, 
explaining namespaces == modules. 
He was worried if we can stay compatible if we 
add namespaces later - so we might have to do namespaces in first 
""official"" version.","2002-05-18","30"

to.","2002-05-18","30"
"894","365","7","
The next day, Reinhard told Jan btw 
saw your ROADMAP and agree mostly, but issues such as 
introspection or support of more than 
one database or security concept. Jan said he thought 
introspection should be implemented when 
the GClassDef/GObjDef Stubs are added. that means before v 0.0.2. 
Reinhard agreed - if we decide to put class 
definitions in the database then introspection will be easy anyway.
Jan said I think we have to put very very basic 
introspection support into v 0.0.1 just to make the dbadapter 
work.","2002-05-18","30"
"895","365","8","Jan also suggested adding 0.0.4   has very 
basic security support (=login and password check) to the roadmap.
Reinhard said that it was probably best to have a firm roadmap to 0.1.0, 
then add - Later (unsorted). Jan 
said he saw 0.5 as an important milestone 
as this is the point where appserver supports 
transactions. i.e. appserver is getting usable in large enviroments, like 0.1 
means usable for a small application. Reinhard wasn't sure whether it 
made sense to plan that far ahead - what we could 
do is just list the post-0.1 features unsorted and decide about the order to 
implement them later - after talking to jamest and jcater about appserver and 
what they want to see - and maybe after getting experiences with 0.1 and seeing 
what is missing most urgently, adding 
Planung ist die Ersetzung des Zufalls durch 
Irrtum. Planning is the 
replacement of the coincidence by mistake. Jan accepted this, 
but said I would like to have a ""Version 1.0 must 
have"" in the roadmap. just to see what feature is really really needed 
for that important milestone.","2002-05-18","30"

box. Jan said as I understand it : appserver 
needs GNURPC to run. but there is only XMLRPC working now. Other 
possible transports included SOAP, Corba, piro...

start for data access.","2002-05-18","30"

Peter Sullivan (psu) explained the original 
App Server was in C - the current re-write is in python. He 
explained a) people write appservers in java, 
which is if anything slower - b) if we get serious perf issues, we can 
optimise the key parts of code in C & link them in - as python is a 
good C wrapper. Reinhard said well

Main problem is that most of the standard

Reinhard said i don't know XML and i 
still pretend to work for this project. Peter said that the 
transistion from HTML to XML was fairly painless - after all, 
*I* understand XML, at least enuf 
to write it. Gilbert
wasn't convinced - XML is one ugly 
mother. Peter said Eventually,

there a design decision behind that, or is it just ""not at this time""?

because of the html, but then I saw the dhtml (your dcl_dict i think it was), 
and I said hey! that's how you do it with html! so where are the ctrees?

do a tree on a palm pilot, or curses or with a 
telephone? He added we are not opposed to 
such items, but because they cause other issues they are not super high on the 
todo list - but we would be willing to do or support as much as possible others 
efforts to do such things. John felt the curses 
point is rather moot seing as designer picks up its widget lists from 
wxwindows. Derek said we made a decision that 
for now designer would be dependent on wx - but applications should not - as we 
dont see a huge value in having a full fledge IDE for palm or the telephone :) - 
we do see value in having applications run there :)","2002-05-20","30"

say - and 'official applications' would not use it. John said 
not unless we came up with a curses way of looking at

whether sub-reports were possible. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said that

"907","370","1","Harald Meyer (Harald1) asked where 
are the methods of business objects stored in GNUe 
Application Server version 2. Reinhard Müller 
(reinhard) said along 
with the class definitions - we haven't set it in stone but 
i strongly believe it will be in the database. 
Yurii Rashkovskii (Yurik) asked you 
mean you'll store code in db?. Reinhard confirmed 
this - gcd or xml will only 
be a means to trasport it - but at runtime all this will 
come from the db.","2002-05-22","31"
"908","370","2","Harald asked are the set of 
language for methods implementation a limited one?
Reinhard said that support for methods written in languagues 
other than python is very low on 
priority - and i'm still not sure if it makes sense to support 
compiled languages for methods. Yurii suggested this 
might be important for 
the time-critical methods at least. 
Reinhard said that two appservers
(with load balancing) could have different operating 
systems or processors, which would make compiled method code 
impractical, and i don't think 
compiling method code gains much performance - as opposed to 
for example optimization of db access.","2002-05-22","31"
"909","370","3","Harald asked if thie meant that 
if two business objects have some methods which are identical, 
these have to be stored twice? Reinhard said yes, 
but this won't be the case very 
often (imho). Yurii said that, on his project, 
attributes & methods 
are separated. methods are just reffered from the database to 
their location at services that run that methods - so method 
could be implemented in any language - the only one thing is 
that this method wrapper must be able to talk w/ its 
service He felt that 
storing code in db is a bad idea.
Harald said he did not have 
anything against storing the code in the db. but what I 
think would be better: don't store the methods with the 
objects, but just referr to them.","2002-05-22","31"
"910","370","4","Yurii asked whether GNUe Application Server would 
start method code on each 
request for this method execution? Reinhard said he 
was not sure, but 
i think we 
should aim at something like - method code can be dynamically 
changed while server is running and on next invocation new code 
is active - but appserver caches method code and if not changed  
then it can use (precompiled) version in cache.","2002-05-22","31"
"911","370","5","Reinhard said that a lot of these issues could be 
reviewed once they had some working code, and could see the 
impact of different ways of working - 
we can discuss about the best way 
to store methods for 3 years and not write a single line of code -
i know it because the gnu enterprise project worked like this for 3 
years until derek came and kicked our butts :). Different 
people had different ideas about how things would work as of time 
of writing.","2002-05-22","31"
"912","370","6","Harald asked can/will business 
objects run automatically or only if the are controlled by a 
user? For example, automatic re-ordering of products 
that fall below minium stock levels. Reinhard said that business
objects do not act, they are 
acted upon but invoked 
by the user or invoked by cron doesn't make much 
difference. Harald said he hadn't been clear about 
what a  business object was from Reinhard's whitepaper. 
He asked whether the data itself is 
part of the business object, or is it just the definition of 
the data?. Reinhard said that 
business object can actually mean 
both - he preferred the terms 
a business object class or 
a business object instance where a distinction was 
needed.","2002-05-22","31"

appserver where the intelligence belongs. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that 
some basic functions will be 
usable in GNUe Application Server (GEAS) in about a week. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said i

think that in a 3-tier environement the client=forms should as light

like that. views would live in the middleware = geasV2. 
However, if views could be added to the 
db abstraction layer in common, to make 2-tier support this too. would 
be great. John felt nobody 
should be building 2-tier apps :) Jan said 
gnue will give you the choice. ;). 
However, There will be a point where some 
features, f.e. views, transactions, locking... will be quite difficult 
to add to the db abstraction in common, and where its more praticable 
to move it up one layer. just because of programming issues.","2002-05-22","31"

and the view will be defined in some xml format? Jan 
agreed - but don't expect that feature

"917","373","1","It was asked if Designer could be used to change the table 
structure in the underlying database. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said if you want 
to change your database structure, you can't use designer for that 
task (yet :). For large applications, 
he said currently, we are all waiting 
for the application server, which sits between the forms and the 
database - when it is usable, we can write big applications on top 
of the gnu enterprise tools - but you can use current gnue as a ms 
access replacement very well - there are some in-house applications 
written by some core team people. He explained that 
gnue reports makes heavy use of sablotron, 
which is an xsl transformation processor. it processes xml->text and 
xml->xml - thus, you have to install PySablot (the python binding for 
sablotron) to make Reports work.. He confirmed that the 
GNUe tools were all written in python - it's 
a really fine language. He confirmed that 
XML made by Designer is stored in files, but 
there will be facilities to let it reside on the server as well. 
The validation code doesn't have to be copied 
into every forms definition file, as it was part of the Forms 
client.","2002-05-23","31"

it's incredible how a word, a simple word,

The latter seems what I need, but I'm not sure.
James Thompson (jamest) explained _formToUI 
is the form tag to UIfoo mapping - _formToUIWidget is the mapping to the 
numerous widgets that can be created by a single UIfoo instance. 
Marcos said he was almost there. James went on to explain 
right now the entire ui system is created 
from the gfobject tree built by the parser. However, 
this sounds different though. He 
suggested i'd think you could easily add 
a another phased init stage in the form itself but quickly 
changed his mind. Marcos said he could not work out why the container 
for his new widget is a wxPanel...
He explained _createWindow is called with a 
container param. the one passed to my _cW is a wxPanel. should be a 
sxForm, I gues... James said IIRC

wx'ism but he was not sure.","2002-05-23","31"
"923","375","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked is
there something special about variables in python that begin with _?
or is it just a matter of style to name ""private"" variables with _xxx?
(from my understanding python doesn't have the concept of ""public""
and ""private"" members in objects). Jan Ischebeck
(siesel) said if I remeber right _xxx
is the a style to name ""private"" methods. There is an other kind of
pseudo ""private"" methods called __xxx (without __ at the end like
python buildin methods like __getattr__) - what I know for shure is
that some gnue code is depending on the _xxx convention to
distiguish private and public methods, like GNURPC is just exporting
methods without one ""_"" at the beginning and GTrigger (if I remember
right) uses a similar thing too. Reinhard said he thought
it is a good thing anyway IMHO -
i just wanted to know if it's a syntactical thing or ""just style"".","2002-05-25","31"
"924","375","2","He also asked when are python
objects destroyed? Perry Lorier (Isomer) suggested
when their refcount hits 0 I presume.
Jan added and the garbage collector is
aactive. Reinhard suggested that we
need some code to close the db connection for a geasList instance
sometime - when we have the list of active geasList instances all
geasList instances remain referenced as long as the session is
active? Jan confirmed this. Reinhard said he was just
trying to do sort(brain);
Jan suggested don't use bubblesort use
quicksort. ;)","2002-05-25","31"
"925","375","3","Reinhard suggested that when
the form is closed then the session is destroyed. Jan said 
for forms it is no problem, but 
Designer might create more open connections, and 
if you use designer a longer time it 
will create heaps of old geasList objects.. Reinhard 
suggested that Jan should take the 
glory ;) and commit the changes to CVS. He asked 
for clarification about Designer using multiple connections. 
Jan said that If you use Postgres as 
DBdriver there will be only one connect per programm start
but this might not be the case with some of the less functional 
drivers.","2002-05-25","31"
"926","375","4","Jan said that the biggest problem he could see with GNUe 
Application server was implementing GConditions - 
I thought of adding a ""without 
GConditions"" to the v 0.0.1 entry in the ROADMAP. 
Reinhard asked does appserver work 
with released common? or would we have to do a common prerelease 
at the same time? Jan said appserver 
needs the ""dbdriver/appserver"" from today. but it should work with 2-3 
weeks old GNURPC. Reinhard said the last release of GNU-RPC 
(GNUe Common) was significantly older than that, and a new release of 
the two-tier tools was imminent. Reinhard said 
i don't think we will release appserver 
0.0.1 together with the new forms release, but Jan said that 
depended on how soon the next Forms release turned out to be. 
Reinhard said that, for Application Server, 
i think we should release what we have 
as 0.0.1 - maybe add a little testing before - but then we would have 
to talk to jamest/jcater to do a common release at the same time. 
Jan said I just thought it would be good to 
have a already released common to use. i.e. we just would add some wrapper 
code to the new appserver 0.1 to be compatible with the ugly dbdriver/appserver 
implementation of the already 4 month released gnue-common. 
Reinhard was not sure if i like that idea - 
what about helping jamest/jcater to get current common out of the door as
say 0.1.90?. Jan liked this - possibly its 
more clean to release a new common at the time of releasing appserver 
0.1. Reinhard said this might allow a co-ordinated release of 
common 0.2.0, forms 0.2.0, reports 0.2.0 and 
appserver 0.1.0, either all at once or planned over a few days, 
in the same way that the Gnome project released.","2002-05-25","31"
"927","375","5","Reinhard said he would do some 
testing for appserver - and update the docs (fwics the api has changed 
slightly). He added from what i 
hear the release of common isn't delayed due to lack of function - but 
rather lack of time - so if we help them in the release process we could 
speed it up.","2002-05-25","31"
"928","375","6","
Later, Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said that for 
a builtin-in method in python to destroy resources  (close db connection) I think 
you can use __del__ - that method is called before the object is garbage 
collected, afaik. Also, for private attributes starting with ""__"" is sorta 
private in that they get mangled like self.__attribute is mangled to 
self._Class__attribute - attributes 
like _attribute are just a convention 
that means hey don't use this directly....I sort of think of them as 
""protected"" attributes.","2002-05-25","31"
"929","375","7","Reinhard clarified that the first release would 
have 
no object description, but this would be added for future versions. Jan 
did some work on the driver to link the Application Server to Forms. Reinhard 
suggested some directory name changes to avoid confusion with the driver for the 
old, depreciated, version of GNUe Application Server (GEAS). He had 
tried to run the geas server and the geas client on 
two different machines - where i found out that i can't do this because i don't 
have 2 machines w/ python 2.x :(. Jan and Reinhard did a test together 
using https:// over the internet. Reinhard remembered that
iirc geasv1 took over a year until it worked with 
forms this way and suggested setting up 
a demo server for public access. Jan said this might be 
a 'little' security risk.","2002-05-25","31"
"930","375","8","Jan asked do you have any ideas how to send 
conditions to the appserver?. He said if I 
understand it right the actual conditions which will passed to GDataObject are 
some kind of object tree. Which would be a bit complicated to transfer over 
RPC. He suggested that, since GConditions are 
single statements which are connected with ""AND""s and ""OR""s then 
why not transform this conditions in a standart 
form (a^b^c)v(d^e^f) going this way we would just transfer a table instead of 
an object tree (a AND (b AND (c OR d))). He thought that, both in 
principle and in practice this would not be a problem, because this was how 
Forms worked - We take this table and transform it
back into a GConditions object tree. Reinhard said that there could be 
peformance problems with complicated Boolean logic, but most business 
applications 
in practice tended to use fairly simple conditions. The other 
approach to passing
conditions to the Applications Server was to pass lists. 
He explained my thinking was to make the 
method to create a new instance of a class - not be a method of geasList - 
but of geasSession. But now i see that it makes sense to put it into geasList
when i think about how forms works. Jan said 
to be honest, I don't like to have it in 
geasList too. but geasSession isn't good either. Reinhard 
said it made sense because geasList is the 
list of instances that can be scrolled through in the form.","2002-05-25","31"
"931","375","9","Jan suggested I would like to have a 
geasClass in between, which also holds the class definition and can create 
new instances - it doesn't have to be a member of geasList, because every 
new record in forms stores an pointer to the new created geasInstance,
but I still would seperate the functions which are in geasList now into two 
classes. Reinhard said he wanted to keep things simple. 
Jan said If I create a new list, just by 
executing a query. then it really should be a new List and not the same 
list populated with new values. Reinhard did not see why not. 
Jan said it is ok, if you have just one client 
which access only one table at one time. I would prefer a geasClass which 
could generate Iterators, or something like that. However, they 
both agreed it was more a matter of personal taste/programming style.","2002-05-25","31"

sound sooo great - but if we are honest then it's virtually as much as 
you could do with geasv1 after 2 years of development :) 
He said we want to do a 0.0.1 release before 
we implement more stuff - we might implement conditions 
before 0.0.1 - however we must wait for a gnue-common release with gnuRPC 
before we can release appserver - because appserver depends on gnuRPC.

a form before the splash has gone away it *hangs* ! Jason said

more important to be able to get in and out of test forms quickly. 
Jason still was not convinced, but said 
if it were added to connections.conf, 
then GConnections.py is the place to add it. John asked about using 
netrc instead. James said i would think that 
netrc would override connections - so the user could override the system

thinks its not a good idea to hard 
code at all, and that putting it in connections.conf was 
just as much hard coding as his idea. John said it was 
hardconfing it - 
if you put it in your text configuration

i would rather see someone work on

however the sql script to load the inital

time of writing, although it could be easily re-written for any 
SQL-92 compliant database. Bajusz asked how 
appserver knows wich db i use? Reinhard said that 
the connections.conf file needed an entry adding for [gnue] -

make the sql script to load the initial test data as xml under our data 
definition markup and then it would support more than postgresql 
:) Reinhard said he had not been aware of this. 
Derek said it was not fully documented and 
i dont remember if its in GNUe cvs - as we started it for DCL and adopted 
it. It used pysablot and 
sabolotron to convert from XML to a database-specific script using
XML style sheets. He explained basically 
this way you only have to write the table definitions 1 time (in xml) 
- and the create scripts for all the dbs are created automagically for 
you. He believed that you could also use it to fill test data 
or standing data into tables. Reinhard 
suggested that, for official releases, as well as the source XML, the

Derek was able to check the status straight away, as the FSF was now
using DCL for its own internal ""to do"" lists. He said 
i think once we get in swing of things 
with dcl and add some functionality - it will be REALLY powerful for
free software projects, including the GNUe project itself. He was not 
sure why the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate on the GNUe project's 
DCL install was showing as expired. However, if people didn't like the

whatz the release plan? Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said they 
had hoped to do a release last week 
for forms, reports, designer, common, 
but this had not been possible due to other commitments for team members. 
He thought if i could find a windows tester
we could probably bundle some stuff and check it out - i.e. test it - if 
it works well we release. Otherwise, 
i think the best course of action is to 
probably create a branch for the release - and go ahead and have at 
head - and when life becomes sane then tackle a release. He 
noted generally the things that hurt us 
release wise are getting docs updated and getting things tested - we 
have a lot more people with installed systems so it should be easier to 
get 'testers' :) - early releases im not too worried about docs, but 
they are nice to have - we definitely need to get road maps rolling for 
all products - with feature lists by release
- and use the power of cvs to branch/merge as necessary to not 
kill release cycles. Previously, this had not been an issue, 
as not many developers so we could safely 
not hurt releases. Although documentation was important, 
for this release i would suffer with minimal 
docs to get somethign out the door.","2002-05-28","31"

seperate GNUe Common packages for each supported database later.

without problems, we can do a release of appserver 0.0.1 soon.

Derek asked if you run appserver and no rpc 
driver is available what happens?  do you get a good error message telling 
you wehre to get it? Jan said this was the same as trying to use 
an unavailable database driver - it raises an

this idea.","2002-05-28","31"

wondered how it managed to access postgres 
w/o me giving some sort of credentials? Jan said 
its reinhard's code. It just takes your 
LOGNAME and set a bogus password. Derek said, based on his 
testing, i give it a green light 
success - it might make sense to release this as 
Application Server 0.0.1 along with the 0.2.0 Forms/Designer/Common

creating a CVS branch at 0.0.1 was a little excessive.

changes twice. He was open 
to suggestions, but the overall GNUe project was beginning to 
get too big - too many developers - 
too many itches - too many products - to manage on the 
informal basis that had worked fine until now. He said

http://gnuenterprise.org/docs/reporter/flowchart.html,

but not so dated its horridly wrong - he would see if he could 
update it. The initial release of Reports would not be done as a 
remote server at all - just as static 
server - and the release after that woudl probably be ironing out bugs

that would maybe start tackling distributed reports.

to program docs - I can say that for sure. People did 
not have to use LyX to edit the source for the documents - 
LyX is just LaTeX after all - just as 
hand editable as docbook. They had resorted to lyx as

Jason said we honestly tried docbook - 
and it was more effort than worth. Daniel asked 
so when is lyx going to use the 
free xforms? Jason said that this was probably 
dependant on the current freeze for the release of Debian 
3.0 (woody). Daniel said I just 
want to be able to install it without adding non-free 
section - he might try compiling the free version 
from source. He noted wow, 
1.2.0 was just released - like yesterday.

accept a path to hardcode the location of a config file which would 
softcode all other paths. The --config-file option 
appeared to be broken. Jason Cater (jcater) asked for 
a run down on where stuff will go. 
Nick gave the debian-preferred locations for various types of files. 
Jason said that the debian install script for Common would have 
to create the configuration file before running the --config-file 
option, and gave an example of the contents it needed. 
then for all the other tools, use 
--cfg-file /path/to/this/file.","2002-05-29","32"
"967","390","5","Nick said that he needed to give 
this file in a ... non-commital way - like 'these are the paths 
you should install to under --root, and this is the path that 
the config file will be at later'. Jason said that 
I don't think any of the tools (besides 
common) looks for the existance of that file - so you can actually 
create the file wherever. Nick asked 
how will the other apps find the various 
parts after installtion, then? or do they do that through 
common? Jason said the other tools
record where the file should be - so when their executable 
script is run they look for the file - they don't actually look for 
it when you do the ./setup.py. Nick said he understood, 
but I need to say weher things SHOULD be 
and wher ethey SHOULD go (in relation to --root, which will 
eventually be /). He asked, if he had a 
debian-setup.cfg file in the debian/ directory, 
how do I invoke setup to use that for the 
installation, and do I have to install that osmewhere in the target 
directory? Jason said when running 
the setup.py's for anything BUT common, you'll need to pass 
the location of that file using the --cfg-file option.","2002-05-29","32"
"968","390","6","After some more discussion, Jason concluded 
setup.py will not install to the right 
places - you'll have to probably do your own install script to move 
the files around. Nick said Whats 
the point of using setup.py at all? might as well just write a 
debian-specific makefile and bypass all this bullshit. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked if the proble was with the 
distutils. Nick agreed, saying 
I'm going to have to completely rewrite 
the debian packaging work he had already done to 
work around distutils' brokeness - my plan is to write a makefile to do 
it The Debian Way(tm) - it shouldn't be that hard.","2002-05-29","32"

is no way to do this in our setup system? He would like 
to see setup.py stuff in common - so 
we have a real install system. Daniel suggested 
./configure - make install - ;P. 
Jason said that's probably what we'll need 
for debian support - but that can't be our main install mechanism 
as GNUe also needed to support Win32 installs - 
Mac installs. Daniel said mac run 
on top of unix - and supports auto tools - win32 well you guys made a 
separate installer for that anyway. James said that a setup.py 
was easier than autotools for dealing w/ 
python, adding i think with some
effort we could mold distutils and our setup stuff into a kick ass

GNUe. it was not free software but they were willing 
to give us the software for free and set us up for testing and such
- then like a month later they were basically swallowed by red hat 
and i stopped pursuing it as they 
got busy and we got busy. He 
added mainly our biggest issue is they 
didnt support python - and since it wasnt open source we couldnt 
write support and give back to them. However, if they were 
at Linux World Expo in San Fransisco, he would 
try to meet with them to revamp the 
issue - as its somethign we need to address. He said that

like paypal, but there are a LOT 
more visa/mastercard holders than paypal holders.","2002-05-30","32"
"971","392","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked how to set options for his new 
main tool bar and main menu widgets. If it was just  
a form option he would just use 
a <form> 
attr but, as the tool bar itself would need attributes, 
I propose a new tag. 
Jason Cater (jcater) asked whether Marcos was trying to 
enable/disable the toolbars - or 
customization. For the latter, jamest 
has a lot of code in place for that that we need to work with.
Marcos clarified that it was not for 
customization of the buttons on the toolbar, 
but sat, the toolbar position, direction, etc, Jason said he 
did not think the forms file is the place for 
that - I personally think that's more 
of a gnue.conf setting Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
i guess i envisioned is that we woudl have 
base menu and base toolbar and you could configure those via 
gnue.conf but at form level you 
could shut them off. He felt that 
'custom' menus/toolbars woudl be from 
navigator. He definitely do NOT 
think mneus and tool bars belong in forms files - forms should be able to 
'manipulate' those items but should not generate them - if that makes 
sense.","2002-05-30","32"

the billing screen the toolbar is completely superfluous: you don't want 
to do 'next record'; you just want to bill stuff. but in the same 
application we might have a 'product inventory' thing, where the toolbar 
(or its functionality) is needed. Derek clarified that 
im not saying cant do custom - im saying 
custom belongs (imho) in navigator (.gpd) not in .gfd. He 
explained think of it as a framework and the 
menu/toolbar are part of the framework and not the form - so to navigate 
between different forms you probably would use menus and such - if you put 
these in the form you would be repeating the menu structure all over which 
would be a complete nightmare. He emphasised that GNUe was not 
intended to be a feature laden gui's 
like glade - its designed to do hard core 
business applications which could be (as far as possible) 
UI-independant.","2002-05-30","32"

we have to be really careful of what we add - as wx is just 
one UI available. He added I 
hate making widgets only for wx - but I'm thinking if it's a 
""style"" of block - then if the UI doesn't support a grid-style

GNUe will provide invoicing soon -

break logic :). Jason said I'd go 
with a) or c), although siesel asked 
me today to hold off a little on appserver - as he found some 
not-so-good problems w/it - so I'm wondering if we shouldn't just hold 
off a week or two on appserver - (that would let them get conditionals 
working). However, this was really up to the Application Server
people. um, actually, I know he found an issue 
w/win98 support - but honestly, if that's what his issue is,  I'd say

example. Also, appserver 
is not geas it is replacing geas - so i see no problem at all 
starting with appserver-0.0.1 - even when we had geas-0.3.0 -

on info files I'll add a --dump-info-file too :) Daniel said

converted to both man and info formats - anyhow 
as long as we have man pages it matters not how :). Jason clarified 
that the man files were being generated from the inline help -
gfclient --help - so docbook could be 
automatically generated too. Doing it this way meant that 
as soon as someone adds a new command line option
it is automatically documented - both in the --help and in the man 
file. Derek said this was a good idea - some 
day i will look at making it generate docbook instead (or in addition).","2002-06-01","32"

in the code? Derek said it was voted we 
didnt want to encourage 'docs' in code - i.e. we encourage CODE comments - 
but we dont want to bloat the source with 'docs'. Having said that, 
i still think we should be giving every function 
a one line description - so we can use pydoc/happydoc to generate a SHELL - 
to help developers see the big picture with opening a ton of files to find 
things. Jason said the one reason pydoc 
and stuff would still be useful is to compare its annotations to the 
current documentation to see what is lacking i.e., I'd still trust the 
comments to be more up to date than the docs but I certainly wouldn't want 
to rely on the comments to learn the api if that makes sense. 
Things like GNUe Common's API were not worth documenting until they had 
stabalised anyway. Daniel agreed, yoda-like, the

"980","397","1","A few changes were proposed to the Application Server 
documentation. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) agreed, saying 
i think it's important to 
distinguish between tables/columns/fields (database side)
and classes/instances/attributes (object side). 
He was not sure about storing 
object definitions visually - i'd like more to store them 
structured and then have a tool that creates uml from 
that. He noted that a direct link between tables 
and Application Server objects could 
become difficult, because a) we might decide to ditch 
GNUe Class Definitions (gcd) - b) 
DB syntax doesn't exist for every type of attribute (for example 
for indirect fields) - c) DB syntax may be depending on database 
backend. He liked the idea of using dashed arrows to 
indicate dependancies on the GEAS architecture diagram. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said that the 
signature of a method should be provided by GEOR, as 
should the field type. However, the 
whole GEOR stuff isn't defined yet. As of time of 
writing, passing parameters was not a problem 
because GNURPC didn't check the parameter 
format on method calls at the moment :(, but this was 
likely to do better checking in the future. He said 
the next step and the next interface to 
define is the interface to transfer GConditions to appserver.. 
It was asked if there were plans to allow the conditions to be more
complex, including ORs. Jan explained how the syntax for this would 
work.","2002-06-02","32"

what about gnue-forms gnue-designer 
gnue-navigator gnue-repclient gnue-repserver gnue-appserver ?
James said i think i'd be ok w/ that if the

fit well for package names, too :). It was agreed to 
use just gnue-reports for the Reports client, but no-one seemed 
prepared to commit themselves between Jason's choices of 
gnue-reportserver or gnue-reports-server 
?. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
i do not think there is any reason 
to be overtly shortened - as if they are having to start the 
server a lot, we have larger problems than a name :) 
The reason he was pro longer names in 
this case is to prevent confusion. James agreed, pointing out 
that the existing gfclient name conflicted 
with gadfly's client program which 
existed prior to us - and gfdesigner doesn't make sense
as Designer was intended to design things other than Forms. 
James posted the final list of proposed executable names as 
gnue-forms gnue-designer 
gnue-navigator  gnue-appserver gnue-reports 
gnue-reports-server and went off 
to break cvs and all previous 
installs for our tools.","2002-06-02","32"
"983","399","1","Michael Maluck (madlocke) asked why 
is there a query button for a form? why not just query at startup?
James Thompson (jamest) said because I may not 
want to pull every record - i may want to input a filter. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said I have a 6 million 
record customer database, I don't want any raw queries happening against 
that table :) James said you can make 
a form prequery by adding the prequery flag to the datasource tag 
as part of designing the form. To apply a filter to a query, 
press the enter query button - then put in 
std sql wildcard stuff in the fields, using % for a multi-character 
wildcard and _ for a single-character wildcard, then 
exec the query. Michael noted that the tooltip for the Enter Query 
button still said 'prepare query'. James said i 
think we went to enter query everywhere, musta missed one.","2002-06-02","32"
"984","400","1","Michael Maluck (madlocke) asked whether the block tag was still needed - 
he could see no difference between a block and a datasource. 
James Thompson (jamest) said blocks used to do 
more - now they handle navigation IIRC - also a datasource != a table. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that datasources are pretty 
generic - i.e., nothing forms-specific (or any tool-specific) should go there - 
every tool that uses datasources has some logical ""layout"" or other processing 
section like blocks e.g., reports has <sections> that handle grouping - they 
logically serve the same function as blocks - but handle report-specific 
functions. As we implement block ""styles"" (e.g., this infamous grid that everyone 
wants) you'll begin to see the usefulness of blocks more and more. 
Michael said but visual grouping and data 
grouping are too different things, aren't they?, asking 
can i have more than one block for the same 
datasource? Jason wouldn't recommend it, but 
I think you can.","2002-06-02","32"
"985","400","2","Michael said that blocks might cause problems for the layout manager 
he was writing, as entries from the same block might need to go in

between this old and new trigger stuff. 
James Thompson (jamest) said that the main 
diff currently is they are moving out of forms into common which 
meant that other tools such as Reports could theoretically use them. 
However, as of time of writing, the triggers were 
still too formsish.","2002-06-02","32"
"987","401","2","
Two days later, Michael asked what 
kind of namespaces you wanted to create for triggers. 
James said that the trigger namespace 
code is in common - and I think will work ok minus a few 
issues. The main thing I 
still had left to do was implement a real trigger manager that could 
merge namespaces, allow for other trigger languages - right now the 
whole thing is still too forms dependent. Michael asked 
you use the word trigger now for both, 
the event handling and the code that is executed for an event, 
right? Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed this.","2002-06-02","32"

cvs as it is generated on setup.py. James noted that this problem was 
from when I broke things like a month ago. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he was just 
trained to always copy his .conf files to backup before any changes. 
It was reported that deleting the gnue.conf file did not solve the problem. 
Reinhard asked could it be you have another gnue.conf 
somewhere?. After some searching, this proved to be the case. James noted that 
gnue.conf should be completely optional now,

John Lenton (Chipaca) said this was because you're

is in production at several sites - including for a large county government 
in the US - i dont know how that compares to your needs though. 
Eugence asked if the development model was more cathedral or bazaar. 
Dan said that's a fascinating question :)
I think it's bazaar because it's a volunteer effort, but it is voluntarily 
organized. The group has chosen a leader. Individuals defer to others' 
expertise and leadership. They trust each other, but they double-check their 
work. There are several leaders in various projects, and one overall project 
leader. They choose to be that way, and there's nothing requiring it.  
It's just a good idea.","2002-06-03","32"

you had a look at the GComm Proposal the last days? Although there 
is still much missing, I hope it make GNURPC a bit more clear. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly), remembering

suggested you should rename it - 
in fact the code should be renamed to reflect it too - 
GComm is actually a meta project creaed by Dave for GNU Telephony

Jason Cater (jcater) thought that GnuRPC 
is misleading - this is a GNUe thing. He did not think that 
the filenames were a problem, but if you 
think GComm.py is misleading, change it to GRpc.py. 
The official name for GNU-RPC is 
""GNUe-Common RPC Abstraction"" as far as I'm concerned. 
Jan said that he would like ""communication"" in the name somewhere, 
as it was intended to cover MOM (Message 
Oriented Middleware) as well as RPC. Daniel said

Where one table had both a child-parent and a parent-child 
relationship with another (e.g. departments have employees,

look-up combo boxes (e.g. to allow users to look up the 
manager name rather than the manager ID) were failing. 
He said maybe im being lazy here - 
but if i wasnt familiar with forms i would be scratching my head 
pretty hard why this didnt work. He explained 
its not a bug really - 
what happens is the wizard makes it typecast (correctly) - 
but the combobox while storing an int, really displays text - 
so when you select it disappears as the displayed 
text value was not a valid 
integer :). He said if 
we dont call it a bug and fix it - we probably need to 
institute some error message.","2002-06-03","32"

done via triggers, but im 
inclined that someday someone will want - so i wouldnt be 
opposed to making it an 'option', with a

The next day, it was asked how to use a drop-down box to 
add a parent record ""on the fly,"" using a button to call another 
form and then refreshing the drop-down list to include the new 
value. James said right 
now the values in a dropdown are populated at form initialization - but 
never reloaded - so if the values in the table the dropdown pulls form 
change you have to reload the form. I'm open to ideas on how to deal with 
this - i didn't want to refresh values prior to each opening of the 
dropdown as thats a pretty big performance hit and 
and not all db's support a way for a table 
to notify apps that it's values have been altered. i had wondered about 
adding a menu entry to tell the form to refresh it's lookup information - 
but that requires the user to know the table values changed in the first 
place. Perry Lorier (Isomer) noted that 
postgres supports notification.","2002-06-03","32"
"1005","410","4","To allow a form to call another form, James noted that 
there was at one time a runform() command 
in the trigger system - but I'm not sure it's functional at the moment 
as it had troubles w/ launching multiple multipage forms - so it may be 
disabled - what i did as a work arround was launch a whole new form 
instance via pythons (IIRC) system command - it's been a while though 
since I did a form like that and it's at home so I can't check. 
A workaround was proposed, but it meant that when the child form was
closed, the main form also closed.","2002-06-03","32"
"1006","410","5","Later, Derek said his suggestion 
was an option on the entry 
(dropdown) for refresh=""true"". If that is set then when an f7/f8 is 
performed the dropdown contents are refreshed - i dont know if that 
is a good 'coding' solution - but it would be acceptable to me as a 
forms developer. James said that 
might get ugly on large dropdowns. Derek said that was why 
the default for refresh would be false - so 
there is no performance hit unless you specifically ask for it - 
the other option is we dont provision for it and force people to use 
triggers to get the behavior. There was some support for 
James' original idea for a toolbar button and/or menu option to 
refresh all the dropdowns in a form.","2002-06-03","32"
"1007","410","6","Derek said i like idea of adding 
option per entry - then user doesnt have to think about it - it just 
happens. He assumed that when you 
do an f8/f9 only the datasource you are in gets requeried and sources 
linked to it - i.e. master detail. His idea would mean this 
would just be extended to look for foreign 
keys used in dropdown as well. 
James agreed - the bad side 
of this is I typically notice my dropdown is lacking as I'm 
entering/altering a record - not before I query. Derek agreed, 
but said the only alternative was to re-query the dropdown every 
time it was used, but this has the most 
severe performance penalty (which is why i dont like it). 
Another suggestion was to put a dummy row into all dropdowns that,
when selected, called a subform and updated the drop-down afterwards.
Derek said i was 
thinking of some mechanism like that, but then thought maybe the 
menu option to 'refresh' dropdowns or such would be more elegant in 
that situation.","2002-06-03","32"
"1008","411","1","Jason Cater (jcater) noted that Jan Ischebeck (siesel) was 
working on a GCD parser and

if you want to be spending any time on the GCD stuff.","2002-06-04","32"
"1009","411","2","Jan said he was not keen on the GNUe Class Definition (gcd) 
format but 
I thought that we should stay with gcd until the xml format for 
appserver objects is well defined. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
said i really dislike the idea of using 
the gcd's. He would prefer to put effort into getting 
the triggers in GNUe Common working over RPC - 
at which point we have something highly 
functional and not overly complex - and then we can start arguing 
about objects. He thought that the 
gcd's are not of any use without a TON of work, which meant 
gcd data is not useful until you have a 
full object/relational engine. As previously discussed, he 
would prefer to start with just getting 
remote methods working (as it seems 
remote data works now) - and we have a HUGE victory quickly - 
then we tackle how we want to approach object to relational.","2002-06-04","32"
"1010","411","3","Jan noted the GTrigger stuff works well 
if the whole object tree is stored in xml files. If we want to store 
class/table method/trigger definitions in the database, 
GTrigger has to be changed a LOT to make that possible. 
James Thompson (jamest) asked why - wouldn't 
triggers load from the db upon initialization? Jason said 
that bear in mind that the only thing tying us 
to XML is the loadObject methods and the dumpXML - but once the object 
is created, it's created. He personally thought 
it will be a very small step from 
XML-stored GNUe definition files of various kinds 
to database-stored (for those who insist on 
having stuff in the database) :).","2002-06-04","32"
"1011","411","4","Jan said the thing which I don't 
like in GTriggers is that it is a) closely connected to the GObj 
( which is great if you don't have heaps of it (performance?))  
b) it defines namespaces which should defined in a more global 
way in appserver. ( this is the same as GNURPC stores the local 
copy of dynamic objects, which is allready done by appserver 
). James said I'm cool w/ 
changes to the GTrigger system that make it more 
usefull/flexible. Jan said I 
think the GTrigger system is quite optimal for its 
actual use. even new languages should be easy to add - but 
it would be great if we could split it in two parts: a 
very very general one and a part which implement the Namespaces and 
GObj Tree specific functions. He needed
to dig deeper into GTrigger.py.
to decide if this was sensible or not.","2002-06-04","32"
"1012","411","5","Later, Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said i 
saw the commit for the gcd parser - it's your choice; we have a 
working gcd parser in the old geas code in c - 
maybe you would want to write a python wrapper around that instead of 
reimplementing it. Derek said he still did not think gcds had a
future - once we get to a gcd state it 
should be xml - and we shouldnt have much work in parsing it - as we 
have a working xml parser already - which would imho be much quicker 
than wrapping the old one. Jan noted that 
if you look in the appserver/ROADMAP there 
is no object/relational mapper mentioned. Derek agreed, and 
said the current gcd's have almost no 
methods - they are mostly properties (field definitions) - but they 
are laidout like objects which makes them horrid for relational access - 
and why i say they are not highly useful w/o an object/relational mapper 
(imho). Jan concurred - i have 
counted ONE method has code. Derek said 
believe me i wish more than anyone that i 
could put those gcd's to use but he felt that the changes for the 
new Application Server were such to make backwards compatability 
impracticable.","2002-06-04","32"
"1013","412","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked why 
does the <option> tag exist? If it was 
just a way to let some features not be implemented 
by some User Interface (UI) driver then I 
think is the Wrong Way (tm)..... Michael Maluck (madlocke) noted that 
it was only used for tooltips and version 
numbers as of time of writing. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said options aren't part of the core 
code - i.e., you could add your own option types and values to widgets -  and 
access those in triggers. Michael said this could also be done by 
updating existing xmlElements - and if an attribute 
is not marked as required - drivers not supporting it could just ignore 
it... Jason said if you are arguing that tips, 
title, version, etc should be attributes and not options I will certainly go 
along with that - btu if you are arguing to get rid of options altogether I 
don't agree there as I just think it'd make 
sense to have these non-standard things not cluttering up the main xml 
definition.","2002-06-04","32"
"1014","412","2","Michael said that a form parser for a particular UI 
should be able to support everything required 
and interpret it in it's own way and to be able to just ignore some things - 
like this it is natural that some renderers support more than others. 
Jason clarified that the form parser does not ignore 
anything - the UI drivers can ignore things if they need to.
Michael gave an example - you have a button with 
picture and text - the basic definition only allows text. Jason 
said that in this case if we all agreed to support 
mixed buttons, then an image attribute would be added to the existing
button tag, not using the <options> tag. Michael said that adding an 
image attribute to the existing button tag does 
not make sense with curses. Marcos said that the
ncurses UIdriver should ignore the image attr. 
There was no need to create a new picture button widget unless 
you don't like to touch the originals.","2002-06-04","32"
"1015","412","3","Jason asked are you saying we need to provide a 
way for the end-developer to add his own elements ? or are you saying we need 
different xmlElements for different UI drivers? He did not like this 
second idea, as you end up with different 
XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs) for 
each UI driver and then you run into overlap issues. He totally agreed 
that people needed to be able to add new widgets, but I 
don't like the idea of our different UI drivers implementing their own 
xmlElements. Derek Neighbors agreed - it 
goes against the goal of one xml file many UI's.","2002-06-04","32"
"1016","412","4","He would rather have a limited widget set that 
is almost 100% portable to all ui's than a billion widgets where you must look 
at a matrix to see what widgets will work with what ui drivers - if people 
want that they are better off using glade/gtk - or qt - or MFC/visual 
basic. If widgets were highly specific 
to a 'ui' - what is the point in over head of abstraction?
However, he did not want to force people to create a fork to be able to do 
what they wanted. I think we need to make a way 
to do supported/not supported - so if people want to do wild stuff fine - but 
we wont support it (i.e. if someone uses it and the developer goes by by they 
are on their own) - and we define what is ok for OFFICIAL GNUe 
apps.","2002-06-04","32"
"1017","412","5","Derek said that the decision between extending existing tags and 
creating new ones would need taking on almost 
a case by case basis - for an image button, he would prefer to add 
an image="""" attribute to the existing <button> tag (along with a 
mandatory text="""" alternative for non-graphical clients). However, 
if you start say lets do a toolbar 
with a toolbar tag i get nervous - as curses supporting a toolbar is 
a much larger stretch. Michael said that form designers 
needed to know that certain basic widgets were supported in all UIs, with 
other widgets optional.","2002-06-04","32"
"1018","412","6","Marcos supported Jason's point on 'no, 
dtd per uidriver is bad', as then 
you could easily get clash of entities/tags names in different 
UIdrivers. John Lenton (Chipaca) said 
if you write a valid GNUe Form 
Definition (.gfd) in XML, it should make a form 
with any of the drivers - even if it is missing some gizmo if the driver 
doesn't support it. Marcos said that, if each UI used its 
own DTD, how do you say a .gfd is valid? I 
mean, which is the .dtd you're using? XML documents such 
as a gfd should be checked against dtd's, 
not some possible broken parser. Michael asked 
if you want a strict dtd like defined in xml 
spec then i ask why you are doing this xmlElements? Jason 
said we can generate DTDs from our 
xmlElements - people are always 
requesting DTDs - so we are writing a script that will generate a 
DTD from xmlElements.","2002-06-04","32"
"1019","412","7","Michael said he still thought the only problem with a seperate 
DTD for each UI is whene two different

He asked are there xml elements ouside 
GFPArser.py? Jason said that the shared GConditions and 
GDataSources code in GNUe Common used XML too. Marcos asked 
whether there would be a single DTD that could validate any 
GNUe-related XML. Jason said it was more 
important to have a well-defined, common 
xml structure than a formal DTD file to validate this.","2002-06-04","32"

<button text=""foo"">
<option name=""src"" value=""pathtofile/file.png""/>
</button> given our current parser. Marcos was 
concerned that the option class should 
then be too much clever as it would always need to know 
the context of what widget definition
it had been invoked by.","2002-06-04","32"
"1021","412","9","Derek emphasised that he supported people extending GNUe, 
but im concerned with management 
of it. It was an important feature of GNUe that it 
was UI independant, supporting win32, 
curses, gtk, html etc. If all 
of a sudden its littered with custom widgets that work on only 
one or two of these ui's, this could affect the overall 
reputation of the product. As such, he would prefer 
to only support widgets
that can be expressed or be optional(on all ui's) - no option 
BY UI. If a widget 
is mandatory for the application to work its real hard to say 
well the widget only works on X - as that means the application 
only works on X.","2002-06-04","32"
"1022","412","10","Marcos said the question was can 
we extend/make new widgets without hacking gnue? 
Jason said we intend to - 
but you can't currently do it well without getting into GNUe 
internals as of time of writing. Jan Ischebeck 
(siesel) said that, if the <options> tag was not used 
for this, then there is a need for 
an forms extention interface where you can add new types with 
ease and in an standart way. Marcos said he did not 
think many more standard widgets were necessary - 
the rest could be dependant in the 
sense that they could not be rendered and the app still 
works.","2002-06-04","32"
"1023","412","11","He added that you did not need graphics for a usable 
UI - even things like dropdown combo boxes and tooltips could 
be done on curses terminals if required. Jan said 
A good designed text only screen 
can help you input stuff much faster than all that windowZ 
stuff. Marcos agreed totally, but said 
that's another discussion. 
James said that when the curses 
interface worked it knew nothing about dropdowns 
but it still validated that the 
entry value was in the dropdown list. Because 
Forms did not use the UI widget 
logic to validate input this 
let the form fail gracefully 
back. He noted that the 
curses client didn't do a menu at first, but he felt 
that if it's considered core 
then it has to be in all drivers - even if the menu on 
curses came up on hot key.","2002-06-04","32"
"1024","412","12","Marcos concluded 
core things should be 
rendered by all uidrivers, and optional 
widgets are just that, 
optional. Extra widgets might be core or 
optional - they would usually be optional, but
if you come with a 
super-giga widget that does zillions of things simply, 
then it should be discussed if it's core or 
not. He was still hopeful that his 
two new widgets (as discussed in 
)
might become 'core,' but he realised that people 
had not had time to look at them in the rush for 
the new releases. Jason clarified 
I am NOT opposed to allowing 
end developers to add extensions to GNUe that are not 
supported by us. (Custom controls, if you will).  I 
think it's a BAD idea, but I'm not opposed to it.
I AM opposed to having GNUe-supported UI's (or anything 
else ""official"") extend the base XML schema.
This was why he liked the <option> tag as a 
general-purpose container for any custom widgets or 
attributes.","2002-06-04","32"
"1025","413","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked did you guys release 
papo? Marcos Dione (StyXman) said that papo, an 
application using the GNUe framework, was out. check out 
savannah.gnu.org/projects/papo. 
Derek asked is it something usable - i.e. do the forms 
work and such? Marcos said yes, the form 
works. it's in is phoetal stage, but works. Papo would eventually be a full 
Enterprise Resource Planning system for Small to Medium Organisations.","2002-06-04","32"
"1026","413","2","Later, Derek said he did download and test drive 
PAPO :) and had put a story and screenshots on the GNU Enterprise web site. 
He said its kind of cool to see spanish forms :) - 
bad though that im too dumb to change my locale - so that tool tips such would be 
spanish as well.","2002-06-04","32"
"1027","414","1","Continuing 
,
James Thompson (jamest) said that Marcos' supressible toolbar widget was 
similar to ideas he had had - i wanted to add 
visible attributes to lots of stuff in forms including the toolbar. 
This would allow the toolbar to be switched on and off using triggers, 
and hiding a toolbar would have same syntax 
as hiding a entry widget - consistancy is a good thing :)
Marcos Dione (StyXMan) asked why wait till code 
is run? set the toolbar optional by tag or attr. Easier, and more consistent 
for the developer. James explained because 
all the other widgets will work like this too. Marcos certainly liked 
the idea of being able to do things to widgets @ 
runtime - not just visible/invisible, but also enable/disable. 
James said that Marcos' work w/ the 
toolbar would make this easy to implement. Marcos explained how 
this would work, but noted defining your own 
menubar must be done by xml, not triggers. 
James said that the self attribute in triggers 
was not currently working, which made triggers and trigger libraries less useful 
if they have to have hardcoded references. 
However, it had been some time since he had looked at this.","2002-06-05","33"
"1028","415","1","Reprising 
, 
Marcos Dione (StyXman) said he was not keen on using the <option> XML tag to 
hook in non-standard widgets - he would prefer to use attributes on tags, or even 
allow new tags for new widgets. James Thompson (jamest) said that GNUe 
Form Definition (.gfd) files used to support attributes 
in several different ways - both <tagname 
attr=""foo""> or <tagname> <option name='attr'>foo</option> 
had been supported - however, we ended up scrapping that 
old way. Also, the <option> tag had at one stage been used for 
multi-line code like triggers however triggers ended 
up different anyway :). Jason Cater (jcater) noted, however, that 
<option> tags were still used to assign 
non-standard properties to objects in forms that can be retrieved in triggers 
- that's why I don't want to get rid of options completely. 
He agreed, however, that in the cases where an option 
replaced a standard tag, I've never been really thrilled.","2002-06-05","33"
"1029","415","2","Marcos understood the need to keep the <option> tag for this, but 
did not see how it would link to the GFOption object that would handle it - 
as there was usually a one-to-one relationship between Forms XML tags and 
Forms objects. Jason said the <option> tag worked differently - 
all objects have a getOption() method that retrieves 
any <option>s set on it - so basically, any non-standard attributes 
would be options. However, there will 
actually be a GFOption object implicitly created.","2002-06-05","33"
"1030","415","3","Marcos asked how the <options> and <option> tags would 
interact - I realize that <options> is for 
gouping <option>s together - but how does a <options> gets related 
to its parent?. The GNUe Forms Parser code implied that all <option> 
tags were children of the <options> tag, which was a child of the overall 
<forms> tag. Jason said the GFParser file isn't 
quite correct.","2002-06-05","33"
"1031","415","4","Michael Maluck (madlocke) re-expressed his preference for 
a way to add new tags for new widgets
 but still being able to create valid dtds,
as this would make the XML more understandable. He was not sure how this 
would work, however - it might be better to delete 
all options, because options force men to make up decisions ;)
He said it's like with mirrors... when you look 
into it, it will always show you. you can't tell the mirror to show something 
you want to see. there is actually no option ;) - but ok you have the option 
to destroy the mirror ;) Marcos felt wowo, 
that was deep. you'll teach me zen?.","2002-06-05","33"
"1032","415","5","Later, Marcos said that, for common <option>s such as tooltips, 
having to re-write the code to handle it each time would be a pain - 
you'll try to move the tooltip code to a 
class, and part of the core widgets. Other <option>s 
would be more one-offs. I guess the answer is: 
no, don't do it in general. that's what jcater or jamest said yesterday
- do it case by case. Michael said i 
understand their complaints about new tags/attrs that are not in the core 
very good, and he needed to give some more thought to the best 
way of allowing optional widgets - he did not want to end up with 
unofficial patches or an unsupported fork.","2002-06-05","33"
"1033","416","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked if there was a multiselect 
widget. Jason Cater (jcater) said not yet. 
He added we need to think thru how we want it handled - 
it'd be a block style. Marcos did not see why - he was talking about being 
able to select multiple records for a single field. Jason said he was 
thinking of ""fallback"" - i.e., what would a UI driver fall 
back to if it doesn't support this nifty new feature, especially how 
you would tie that directly to a datasource?.","2002-06-05","33"
"1034","416","2","James Thompson (jamest) said that the one thing that 
sucks about putting it in a block is navigation - as I have a similar need that I do 
via a block of dropdowns. Jason said I need
something similar too - so I'm not arguing against such a thing. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said he thought a good form dialog was more important, as 
i dont need the multi select really 'in' a form but rather 
as a 'utility' to rapidly assign data, creating many to many relationships 
between the primary keys of two tables via a switch table - 
once assigned it can be displayed in grid. 
Derek and Marcos traded some practical examples of this. Marcos said, in his 
particular case, he would prefer a muktiselect list 
box as the options are just a few in this 
particular case. John Lenton (Chipaca) suggested 
if they're really few, surely checkboxes are 
better?. Marcos said that checkboxes existed, but it was not always 
easy to get the data back in the database from these.","2002-06-05","33"
"1035","416","3","
The next day, Marcos said I'm gonna do a 
listbox, and asked should I just extend 
entry or better to add a new class?. James confirmed that all 
the entry widgets were all <entry> tags 
with a style. Marcos said the box would start off single-select, 
but would eventually support multi-select.","2002-06-05","33"
"1036","417","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) did some testing of Navigator. James Thompson 
(jamest) noted that menu line entries in the GNUe Process Definition (.gpd) 
file - the standard file format for Navigator - now supported both <title> 
and <description> tags. He confirmed that using Navigator to launch
both Reports and non-GNUe applications was still supported. 
Derek noted that image works now - 
about box doesnt work. James said the menu 
doesn't work yet at all - it's only there for looks at this time 
:) Navigator also does single login 
for multiple forms - which is nice.","2002-06-05","33"
"1037","417","2","Later, Derek posted some screenshots to the website for the 


navigator open screen and 


navigator in actoin. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that the web version of Navigator 
should be working but he had not 
tested it out in last day or two. 
It was not as advanced as the Navigator full client yet, however.","2002-06-05","33"
"1038","417","3","
The next day
Bajusz Tamás (btami) asked is there any special 
reason navigator uses treecontrol instead of classic menus? in a main window?.
He explained some users (accountants) hate using mouse - 
and a main window with menus is maybe simpler. James Thompson (jamest) 
said that the tree can be navigated via the cursor 
keys - and we're just trying things out to see what people think.
Bajusz said that he did not like having two windows - one for Navigator and one 
for the form. James explained navigator can launch 
forms, reports, executables - anything you want really - I have mine here launching 
IIRC perl scripts. He added just remember though 
we're still very much so playing - so if you want to see something just describe 
it. His users needed to be able to have multiple 
forms open at same time, which is why he personally preferred the new 
layout to earlier versions of Navigator. Bajusz suggested 
1 main window with menubar(navigator) - and forms,reports 
are the child windows in it - like excel opened with more then one xls. 
James thought this was an interesting idea - may have 
to do some more playing. He noted that navigator 
takes ui drivers - so nothing prevents us from making something like that in it's 
own UIwxmdi.py. He said the entire UI system is 
under reworking - we need to start a wishlist as I 
really would like to get most the UI stuff nailed down this next release.","2002-06-05","33"
"1039","417","4","Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) thought Navigator was 
giong good though im not sure of two things - 
a. why its dual paned - b. that we cant make gpd's load into menus if we so 
desire. This second option would be useful for curses (text-only) users 
or people really liking deep ugly menus :).","2002-06-05","33"
"1040","418","1","Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked anyone 
know of any small/medium business accounting software?
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested nola - 
its not gnue but well - its accounting that looks promising to do some 
gnue stuff too. Peter Sullivan, remembering 
 
said that Nola was a LAMP application 
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, php) - screenshots look moderately sophisticated 
(but then so do ours) - jcater downloaded for a look-see, you might want 
to ask him when he wakes. He noted that 
there's an online demo on their 
website. 
He felt the look and feel 
isn't terrible, isn't wonderful - and being GPL gets you lots of 
gold stars in my book ;-). Andrew said he 
would still like something GNUeish tho - 
web-based is ok but not ideal for things like printing reports, invoices, 
etc.","2002-06-06","33"
"1041","418","2","Andrew said he doesn't like NOLA's UI 
that much. Peter felt it was 
LAMPish. Andrew said that 
DCL could be called LAMPish, but i think 
it has a better UI - so does phpGW. Derek said that 
nola is far from perfect BUT 
i think its far enough that its a decent start - 
and it would be worth building gnue screens for and such. 
He would probably get gnue screens for 
it.","2002-06-06","33"
"1042","418","3","Derek said he would probably do some work on Nola to 
make it support fund accounting, so that 
you could record separate funds with self 
balancing set of accounts - usually used to observe some restriction or 
limitation of resources. This was a fairly common requirement 
in the US government sector, but he would be using it for church 
accounts, where there were separate funds for different church purposes - 
only instead of having a ton of bank accounts 
you have paper (or virtual) ones. Peter said he had seen similar 
set-ups, where each directorate has own balance 
sheet - but the ""Cash"" figure is not real cash - just their share of the 
central balance sheet. Derek said generally 
every fund has assests, liabilities, fund balance. Peter said
I keep wavering as to whether this is a good 
idea in cases where it was not a statutory requirement, as 
the control aspects can be done w/ good row 
security instead.","2002-06-06","33"
"1043","419","1","Dan Kuykendall (Seek3r) asked if there was any documentation on GComm (GNU-RPC). 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said there was some preliminary documentation in CVS. 
Dan said he was building some code in php to support 
xml-rpc and soap in much the same way. if you already have things defined then I 
can look at doing mines much more like yours. Jan said that, as of time 
of writing, it was too early to decide which functions 
should be made general available for all drivers and which are private 
functions. Dan said Im mostly concerned with 
the basic functions developers wanting to the the GComm are supposed to use. Like what 
they do to start the client, how they package up their params (selecting data types), 
and how they make the calls, and then how the return comes back. 
Ditto with creating a server. how they add functions, how they are documented.
If I can make mine look like a port. so that it basicly matches, then it will be more 
generally consistant. Syntax will be a little diff because of the diffs between python 
and php. Jan said ok, thats quite easy. the only 
difference between python and php implementation will be that python would 
allow you to just request an service object and then all 
method call on that service object will be transparently executed on the 
server as part of GComm. Dan said he could do the 
same with php.","2002-06-06","33"
"1044","419","2","Jan said that, as of time of writing, the api is quite 
simple: client: 1. atach(interface,options) 2. request('servicename') 3. transparent 
calls. As it was not web-based, it used its own 
socket port. Dan said he could not do this, 
Since in PHP I am stateless. I have to wait for the web 
server to kick me into life. Jan did not think this was a problem - 
It just means that you have to parse the 
description file one time per method call ;) - or you keep a preparsed file in a 
php file.","2002-06-06","33"
"1045","419","3","Dan asked if GComm could detect incoming requests using different RPC protocols, 
and select the appropriate driver. Dan and Jan worked through some examples. 
Dan concluded that, in php, he would have to do direct access in a different way 
to the python-based GComm. There might be problems detecting what type of 
object was being sent, but if they use this future 
GTypeCast, they will be giving you an object that you can then get the type and 
data from - this could also be done in PHP. He asked if the data returned 
by an RPC request was automatically converted into python variables. Jan confirmed 
this. Passing multiple parameters to a function would have to be done differently
in PHP to python - although PHP version 4 could do it the python way, Dan needed to 
use PHP version 3 for GPL compatibility. Jan said he would be prepared to change 
the way the python-based GNU-RPC worked, provided it 
doesn't means changing heaps of code.","2002-06-06","33"
"1046","419","4","Dan asked whether GComm and GNUe RPC are two 
different things?. Jason Cater (jcater) said that 
GComm was the original working name before any coding 
was done. It was now interchangeably referred to as GNUe Common, 
GNU-RPC or GNUe-RPC. He emphasised that it was only 
one implementation - the ""standard"" or ""proposal"" can be called whatever - 
but our implementation I'd think we would call GNUe-Something. Dan 
confirmed he was gonna try building a PHP 
version today with the xml-rpc driver for use on 
the new web services I am developing for

"1048","419","6","Dan Bethe (dtm) noted that Dan Kuykendall was 
currently redesigning phpGroupware (phpgw)

Peter Sullivan (psu_) noted that GNUe Common was 
named GNU-RPC precisely because it was meant to be usable by other

to collaborate - and collaboration will probably be greatly enhanced by his 
rearchitecture. 
Derek noted that, although it was not quite the same issue as phpgw using 
GNU-RPC, two separate people had started writing GNUe Forms clients in 
php, and after grokking common decided 
to use (and in one case, help to develop) that instead. It was much 
more than merely data abstraction (ala 
PEAR or PERL DBI or libGDA) - its 
complete programmer abstraction including features 
like handling master detail relationships
adn complex queries and foreign key look ups and the such.

business-related GNU projects working together. One key issue was 
where GNUe is at with its rpc abstraction -

loading an instance or creating a new instance had to be 
done over the list object. 
The reason for this was to move 
the resultset / row paradigm into an api. so you have to

rush after Team USA got a lucky draw against South 
Korea in the soccer World Cup, Marius Gedminas (mgedmin) asked 
if someone's working on problems 
with PostgreSQL numeric types - (SQL errors like ""operator = not 
defined for numeric and double"") (when trying to update a 
record containing a numeric field) using the 
psycopg database driver. He reported 
basically postgres wants explicit 
typecasts in statements like UPDATE employee SET foo=bar WHERE 
numericfield=123.4::numeric. Derek was able to reproduce 
the bug - someone has introduced a 
bug in cvs OR the pyscopg driver in sid has been changed - as 
when i ran this form before the form had worked. 
They both tried various alternatives, including 
=1, ='1' and =1:numeric. Marius confirmed that his 
PostgreSQL reference book implied that it 
wants a typecast when it sees 
a numeric type in the WHERE part. He confirmed that 
it works fine when you try to 
add new records - it fails when you try to update them - 
or perform a query (no error messages, but no results either in 
that case). He gave the workaround he had developed - 
I don't like that though. 
Derek agreed - if it chokes other db's 
it needs to be in the postgres driver and not in the GNUe 
code. He asked Marius to submit it as a bug, and the workaround 
as a possible patch, pending an official 
patch.","2002-06-09","33"
"1057","424","2","He noted that there was no problem with integer fields, which

issues emerging here, and felt it was best

"1058","424","3","Later, Jason Cater (jcater) said he was not impressed that 
PostgreSQL could not handle implicit 
numeric conversions. He felt that getting the database 
driver code to check for specific numeric types and do the 
conversion itself if necessary 
may 
not be too hard but if it meant we 
have to do full-on introspection at form load time to check 
the types of all numeric fields that 
could be a big performance hit. Derek said he 
hopes this is a postgres bug, but doubts 
it - as i have postgres 6.5.x here and it does same thing. 
Jason felt any ""reason"" they can provide is 
a technical one that should be hidden from SQL 
users.","2002-06-09","33"
"1059","424","4","Marius pointed out that forms 
currently perform the updates by constructing an SQL statement 
and listing all fields in WHERE clause.  Is there 
a way to use only the primary key instead? Jason said 
that's something we need to look 
at. For most databases, the 
database's ""row id"" is used - IF the database supports such a 
thing. However, in PostgreSQL 7.2 and higher, 
oid's are optional.","2002-06-09","33"
"1060","424","5","There was some discussion about whether this, and the 
numeric conversion problem, were desirable or not. But, 
as Derek noted, postgres is 
a db people will be using, we need to support their quirks 
whether we agree or disagree with them. He 
suggested changing Forms to identify different types of 
numeric field separately. Jason said he 
was trying really 
hard to avoid that - as it goes into support issues I didn't 
want to deal with. Derek said he did not like it either, 
but the only other way of resolving the issue was to use database
introspection to check the exact type of numeric fields every 
time they were used.","2002-06-09","33"
"1061","424","6","
Some days later, Marius suggested resolving the issue of 
having to list all of the fields in the WHERE clause of an 
update query by having a 'key' attribute against each entry 
field on a form - and the SQL query 
should only list fields with key==TRUE in the WHERE part. 
Derek said he was not sure of this - all 
too often people dont make proper keys. Marius felt that 
imho the union of all fields in a block 
is less likely to be a proper key than a developer defined set of 
fields. Jason said he had purposely 
avoided that approach in the past. Given that 
we're gonna have to do a quick schema 
lookup on form startup anyway so 
we can solve these numeric issues, the code might 
as well as get the primary keys if 
defined - and fall back to using the whole record if a table has 
no primary key. This was not ideal, but 
would solve several issues at 
once.","2002-06-09","33"

should be able to do useful things with gnue w/o being a 
GNUe developer - BUT - i think they need to be a developer

be a GNUe tool developer, but they should have application 
development experience. For testing,
currently i have like 3 forms 
i use to 'test' things - as i find forms that 'break' 
things - i try to shovel them into my 'test' suite. 
He wanted to look at unit tester
that will test functions of GNUe w/o actually running forms - 
at some point we will need to build or find a free test suite 
to automate testing since as 
more people start to bring GNUe into production the more 
important test suite will come.","2002-06-09","33"

much rows want to see at once, and the block should pass that

Derek Neighbors (derek) said that was 
jamest original intent iirc. James Thompson (jamest)

scrollbars were going to do - look at the block/datasource 
to get record count and based upon the rows (visible) set 
the size of the scroller - then set the up/down of the scroolbar 
to only really do a next/prev record event - after each next/prev 
event have the scrollbar look at the top visible record and adjust

automation - but each needs 'varying' degrees. At 
one time, a ""base"" package had been proposed, 
but do to do that schemas and

Derek noted that the document had neatly predicted the need for 
a database-independant way of creating and updating database 
schemas, which they now had with the DCL schema generator that 
used XML. This could be expanded to include not just the data 
about what tables and fields were required, but also meta data 
about dependancies to say when

that now he was hoping to add a scrollable widget, this might 
need changing. James had never

a day of work. When challenged, he asked for the schema

look at navigator code to see how it opens form, implement that in

a bit better lately - it had not been 
included in the 0.3.0 group release

you could try :) - looks like you have to 
tell it to parse form too - seems almost too simple... ;). 
Marius agreed - only 50 lines of Python 
code ;). Jan said there is a trigger 
solution too: look in forms/samples/location/forms/runform.gfd. 
Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) noted this 
does open a new form, but is it possible to avoid that request window

back. Later, Marius summarised 1. 
updating a boolean field through a checkbox does not work due to UI issues -

to use GTrigger from common without many modifications we have to go 
that way. Reinhard said that 
trigger definitions (and later object 
definitions) should be a separate module, in order to allow 
a more dynamic approach

that both the old .gcd format and ODL had the drawback that 
the method code has to be separatly defined. 
Derek said that remote methods(triggers) and normal 
db wuold be HUGE to start with - none of the existing .gcds had any methods 
defined in them anyway. Jan said that was not quite right: 
there is ONE full coded method in there ;) Daniel said 
so the idea is to include the method code in the 
object description? does this rule out supporting other languages in a decent 
way? Jason Cater (jcater) said I think the 
idea is to just get method code out there - regardless of an object description 
:). Derek said basically what that gives 
us is xplatform db triggers. He was not 
against object to relational mappers in any way shape or form in the 
future but i want best bang for buck in 
the short term. He said if we do remote triggers/ 
remote db - we are n-tier as advertised - and gain the benefits from 
that.","2002-06-19","35"
"1095","447","3","Jan asked how triggers would be defined - would they be 
 stored in a datastructure (i.e. in the database, 
i.e. in a table) - and if a form wants to call a trigger it calls it? 
Daniel said this implied that appserver would need 
to know something about the forms definition right? assuming you keep the 
trigger declarations in the gfd. Jason said that the aim was to 
avoid actually defining the triggers in the .gfd (GNUe Forms Definition) - 
the form would access triggers via the common 
""appserver"" driver - which would use grpc.","2002-06-19","35"
"1096","447","4","Later, Derek said that the remote application server triggers would 
replace the database-level triggers - im thinking 
in the client you define 'trigger' spaces to import or include - then you can 
call triggers in those spaces. A trigger might be something like 
validating a bank account number - the Form could just call something like 
accounts.isValid, which the Application 
Server would then execute and return the result. He added 
personally i see data going remotely too - 
this was part of my problems with putting data functionality in blocks - 
as my long term goal was that you would have local datasources or 
remote datasources  so in an n-tier application you would point your 
datasource to a remote datasource. Jan said that 
if you have local and remote triggers, then in 
case of remote triggers you should distinguish between data bound triggers 
and gui bound triggers.","2002-06-19","35"
"1097","448","1","John Lenton (Chipaca) noted that there were problems with checkboxes - 
basically if you're just using them for displaying 
data from the db they'll work, but they don't modify the data. 
Chad Walstrom (^chewie) confirmed this, using 
BOOLEAN type in a PostgreSQL table. John said he was 
using char(1), but was getting the same 
issue.","2002-06-20","35"
"1098","448","2","Using a button instead of a checkbox, John reported the 
trigger to the button is called *twice* - how can I stop that happening? 
Chad suggested scold it vehemently. John 
discovered that I'm getting it once for click, and once 
for unclick :/ - and I can't just assume that is the case, because it the user 
clicks on the button and then moves the mouse off, I get the click but not the 
unclick. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that best practice was to tie 
the trigger to the unclick event - if the user clicks 
the button and moves away from it nothing should happen - 
the trigger should be fired if and only if the butten 
receives an unclick after it has received a click and there was no other unclick in 
between. John agreed, but noted two different 
events are snagging the trigger: wxMouseEvent, and wxCommandEvent. He 
went to look for the wxMouseEvent thing to kill it with 
extreme prejudice and reported ROTFL, that fixed 
it. He felt there must be a way (at least in wx) 
to say 'I've handled this, don't propagate it any further'.","2002-06-20","35"

in DCL for converting XML database definitions into database

for the GNUe Application Server. He asked where these should be 
placed in GNUe's CVS. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked Jan to  
check in the .xml file as well as the 
processed .sql files (so we dont make xslt processing a requirement 
for cvs users) yet :). HE personally would like to 
restructure CVS to move samples and 
things like this out as well as docs of the modules - but thats a 
major undertaking and we certainly dont all feel that way :)

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) and Stuart Bain (stbain) were 
trying out some other GPL-ed finance packages to look at the

through extracting the schemas in the XML format.
Derek noted that Jan was moving the code that used this 
from the DCL CVS into GNUe Common (GNU-RPC). 
Jan said he had not done so yet, as he was not sure where it 
should go. Derek said basically 
we have the python script that wraps the xslt processor (though 
any xslt processor could be used).","2002-06-23","35"

a quick way of supporting multiple databases, it also produced 
excellent schema documentation - he

to use gnue common and its

was included in designer.exe and forms.exe. 
Stuart reported that Designer likes to save me the 
trouble of closing designer whenever I tried to select a connection. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested running Designer from the command line 
and pass it --debug-level=10 to see 
what the error message was. Jason asked are you sure 
it's a valid connections.conf entry? Derek said that Stuart's 
connections.conf seemed somewhat sane - 
but regardless even with a hosed connections.conf it shouldnt just crash

tried it with both 'localhost' and the IP

for odbc, mysql, pypgsql compiled in.","2002-06-23","35"
"1103","450","2","Derek said fwiw we have had lots o issues with 
mysql driver. Stuart suggested trying the ODBC driver in the meantime.
Andrew reported that mysql odbc driver has 
issues on current debian. Jason noted that the README for the 
ODBC driver, written by Marc-André Lemburg 
advised that 1. This driver has not been fully 
tested.  If you are successfully using this driver, please let us know.
2. This driver does not yet support schema introspection, so you will not
be able to use Wizards in GNUe Designer. Stuart confirmed 
you're right... no Wizards. Andrew 
asked so who's going to add introspection 
support to the ODBC driver then?. However, standard ODBC did not 
support introspection at all, and Jason said that the 
underlying odbc driver (C driver) that was being used 
doesn't support the ODBC extensions to 
support introspection - so until someone sends them 
a patch, not much we can do :) This might be a good project for 
any fans of C who had been put off contributing to GNUe by its python-based 
culture.","2002-06-23","35"

problem - he had python already installed,

c:\Python21 and trying to use the MySQL driver from there. 
Jason said that the McMillan installer should pickup 
our drivers before searching the python path. Stuart said he had
no PYTHONPATH set - but I'm betting there are 
some registry entries. Andrew reported the 
same 'Cannot load MySQLdb' error - and this is on a clean box, no other python

downloaded the .exe installers today.","2002-06-23","35"

i will bet you can edit properties. He noted 
this behavior is pretty erratic

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said i would 
say look at a sample BUT i think jcater took my suggestion and 
changed how dropdowns work :) Derek explained the basic 
scenario, with bar having foo as a foreign key. You needed to 
add the foo look-up table as an additional datasource for the form. 
Then go to tableBar.fooid entry
and open up property inspector change its type(style) to dropdown
then go up to foreign key seciont. In foreign key data source put 
name of datasource you just made - in lookup/key put fooid - 
in fk description put foodesc. This was new functionality
as lookups used to only have two fields 
not three - it had been added since the 0.3.0 releases, but 
CVS had it. You also needed to set prequery=""true"" on the new 
foreign key datasource to ensure that the look-up was 
automatically populated whenever the form was opened.","2002-06-24","35"

a datasource that accesses multiple tables and asked how to 
do that. This was a 1:1 rather than 
a master-detail or foreign key lookup, both of which were already

using a <datasource type=""join""> tag. Marcos Dione (StyXman) said 
he had thought of something similar to Jason's first suggestion. 
John said that the type=""join"" was probably unecessary as 
because the name (""table1,table2"") is easily 
reckognizable as a join. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) 
suggested why not do this in the db?
why not make a 'view' or such? Jason said that 
to do a view each time is a biotch, 
and Marcos pointed out that not all databases supported them. 
Derek conceeded this, but said he was not keen on the proposed 
syntax. Jason said he was trying to think 
of a better way and can't - using conditions makes sense to me, though
- as sometimes the joins can be complex. He wanted to 
avoid creating a <table> tag, as this might be needed as a 
reserved word elsewhere. John suggested keeping it simple to start 
with, and dealing with complications like inner and outer joins later.

James Thompson (jamest) said he had been unable to get

slowly :). Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt 
the app itself is a bit heavy for 
me, but if you could produce docs with XSLT it'd be fine

slow - but after started it runs ok. Christian 
suggested why not use something that 
anyone can produce, anyone can read and anyone can understand?

why im so pro docbook - is its just xml - which bsically is ascii - 
problem is no good editor (if you dont want to edit ascii (with xml 
tags)) AND the 'output generation tools' cause some folks to go 
delirious :) - er more delirious. OpenOffice 
does work aon about any platform 
reasonably well but was resource-hungry and hence
not great on older hardware (but 
usable on it). James said that people without OpenOffice 
could just unzip it and edit the XML with any text editor. 
Derek said i still say we take any 
format - but its likely my next few docs will be in

system. Perry noted that with 
python, you can fudge it and package and unpackage the procedure

kind of .idl file. Andrew suggested 
look at appserver/grpc/GEAS.grpc -

what he had been looking for - looks 
like it would work really well with my idea. He 
expanded my ""brilliant"" idea was that 
.o files usually contain debugging information that gives you the 
types of all the symbols - if they are compiled with -g anyway - 
since you know all the symbols in the file (nm) and you can tell 
the types (stabs) then you can automatically create a idl file 
(and, as suggested a .grpc file) and, since most languages can 
use gnu-rpc of some description (even if it's only corba, or soap 
or similar) - this means you should be able to write one component 
in one language (say ""C"") and another component in another language 
(""C++""), take the .o files, generate the idl, and then connect 'em 
all together.","2002-06-27","36"

attributes to the conditions

its by far better than postgres and mysql put together. Peter asked 
are noguska actively developing nola, or is this in 
effect the main develop stream? Derek said 
yes they are actively developing - currently they 
are kind of dead i.e. busy on other projects - but they are looking to hire 
someone to clean it up and finish it. He said there was a need for 
testers willing to beat on our version so we can 
send back to NOLA. Peter volunteered to help out.","2002-06-27","36"
"1130","464","2","
Some days later, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said he had been 
planning to do an accounting system in 
PHP and python, but would prefer not to duplicate 
lots of work ;). Micah Yoder (MicahY) said he was working
on converting web forms in nola to gnue 
forms.. He said that Derek had done most of the work on cleaning 
up the web/php cvs - and I studied some of the 
code and database schema and made a form. Derek said 
um we need a dcl setup for GNUe NOLA i think - 
so we can road map what there is to do and such. It still needs testing, 
testing, testing against our version.","2002-06-27","36"
"1131","464","3","Micah said 
I hate to mess much with the php version - 
just enough to know what it's doing and be able to convert it to forms. 
Derek agreed, but said we are trying to 'play' 
nice - which means we need a working php version so i can submit back the 
changes to them. He was trying to avoid creating a fork from his 
side - it was up to Nogasaka to decide whether to accept the changes or not.
He personally hoped there would not be a fork, both from the point of 
view of publicity (we dont want conotatoin of 
being leeches) and of being able to keep the GNUe Forms version and 
PHP version of NOLA in synch so that people could still use the PHP interface
for parts of the system for which GNUe Forms were still being developed. 
Micah felt that Nogasaku would not want to distribute the 
GNUe Forms version and their original PHP interface 
in same tarball. 
Derek said i imagine what would be logic would 
be to separate (as already is) the data/schema and ui's - so you could tar 
each independently if necessary.
Micah agreed, adding their web system IS 
pretty nice... some good work was put into the look and style of 
it..... Derek said that lets face 
it some people are hell bent on having a web system - /me shudders at web 
accounting, but to each their own.","2002-06-27","36"
"1132","464","4","Micah did some more testing, and wondered if some of the bugs 
he was finding were specific to the PostgreSQL version - 
in which case maybe I should go ahead 
and set up mysql for it. Derek urged him to use the
tar ball from gnue and postgres as 
thats what needs testing. The code had been set up in 
a seperate CVS on the gnuenterprise server, not as part of the 
normal GNUe CVS on savannah.gnu.org, but 
snapshots
were available for people without access to CVS.","2002-06-27","36"
"1133","464","5","Micah went on to try a form for GL Accounts, using the 
Designer master-detail wizard to include a look-up for Account type. 
This was just a very small part of a very large overall schema. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) felt that many of the primary/foreign 
keys were not set up ideally, probably because 
this was dumped from mysql? 
and then converted? In PostgreSQL, it was better to
use the REFERENCES word for relations
and maintains referntial intergrity for you. He suggested 
the most logical would be to convert 
the xml db-agnostic format right ;) as mentioned in 
,
noting that this was in the TODO 
:).","2002-06-27","36"
"1134","464","6","MMicah downloaded CVS, and noted that 
the defines.php file has system-specific 
databasename/login info - he would probably just change his 
database to accept that username and password rather than change the 
code. However, it still had flags set incorrectly - 
that is what requires the non-free 
fonts. - I had to set them to zero to make it work. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that can be your 
first commit :), noting what you see 
in that cvs right now is the result of 4 hrs of my time, 
and welcomed any input people could give. Daniel downloaded the code, 
and noted PHP is fugly next to 
python. Jason said I hope ppl only 
spend enough time in the PHP version to figure out how to do a Forms 
version. Daniel was impressed that pie charts were 
included.","2002-06-27","36"
"1135","464","7","
After midnight, Micah noted that the PostgreSQL schema did 
not have default values set for any field - 
I guess the script missed them. 
:(. Derek said this is why he wanted to use the XML 
schema extraction tool mentioned in the day before, 
which should include everything except 
indexes. Micah noted that there were other problems with 
adding new account types. Derek said he had seen 
mail from stbain that said this 
was beta (even their stuff) - its quite possible no one has 
tried to add additional types yet. He felt he 
should setup NOLA + MySQL out 
of box then setup Acclite + Postgres - 
so can do side by side comparisons 
when there are issues.","2002-06-27","36"
"1136","464","8","Micah did some more testing, having to switch from Mozilla 
to Konqueror due to some odd behaviour with the ""back"" button. 
Peter felt that in db-based web apps
back button can be misleading as people think it = undo - 
but you've still committed your changes. Micah agreed, but 
said I know what I'm doing and want 
to use it. :).","2002-06-27","36"
"1137","464","9","Later, Stuart Quimby (ToyMan) asked you 
guys are gutting nola *really* thouroughly, yes?. Jason
said not really gutting - as much as making 
it work with postgresql instead of mysql. The 
first step is to get schema into postgres
so it works with current php logic - then when we have the schema down
we create replacement GFDs for the PHPs - that's the plan at 
least.","2002-06-27","36"
"1138","464","10","Later, Micah reported problems trying 
to get it to add vendors. After some investigation, 
Jason suggested that the update was failing because the names were 
stored as char fields rather than varchar, and hence the trailing 
spaces were breaking the match. Derek said he 
forgets people even still use CHAR for 
anything - definitely we should be using varchar for postgres. 
Micah said he would also go through the 
schema and add 'default now()' to the timestamp types that don't have 
them - as that was an issue in a couple places.","2002-06-27","36"
"1139","464","11","
The next day, Andrew noted a security 
hole for NOLA on bugtraq - says 
that users can upload what they want thru upload pages - NOLA does no 
checks (they can upload php files, etc). Jason said that this 
was not as serious as it sounded, as anyone 
who runs a publicly accessible NOLA install (accounting, mind you)
just aint right. Applications like this would normally be 
very much inside the firewall. For internal users, 
/me isn't too worried about my accountants 
h4x0ring their accounting package.","2002-06-27","36"
"1140","464","12","Later, Micah asked is there 
a place on the web to find cvs commits for acclite? He 
did not want to subscribe to the commit 
maillist as he already got too 
much crap in the mail. :) Peter said that there probably was 
not, as the acclite CVS was on the gnuenterprise server, not 
savannah.gnu.org.","2002-06-27","36"
"1141","465","1","Further to 
, 
Jason Cater (jcater) announced he had added schema extraction to GNUe 
Designer via a Wizard - reads table definitions from 
the database - and creates a GNUe Schema Definition. This worked with 
any database driver in GNUe Common (GNU-RPC) that 
supports introspection. It currently only 
grabs tables/fields/default values/nullable settings - does not grab 
sequences/triggers/primary keys/foreign keys as of time of 
writing - that's really the biggest deficiency of 
it right now i.e., it doesn't extract integrity constraints - but, heh, 
this is only a few hours of work so far ;)","2002-06-27","36"
"1142","466","1","It was reported that GNUe's CVS install was still giving an 
error message saying that PyXML was not installed. 
James Thompson (jamest) confirmed it was no longer required, 
as previously discussed in 
 -
we must have missed removing that test
as the xml included in python 2.x is now supported. However some 
distros (like debian) split the xml off for some odd 
reason. He would check this later, and remove the 
unneeded checks if they were still there.","2002-06-28","36"
"1143","466","2","
The next day, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) reported that Application 
Server was asking for the PyXML 
package. Jason wondered why - he had 
worked hard to get rid of that dependency. 
Andrew said dunno, but it chokes without it 
:).","2002-06-28","36"
"1144","467","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he was 
on mission to check out 
sap much closer 
as well - as i found out they have OLAP functions too (or so it 
seems). He noted that SAP-DB had an 'Oracle mode' 
that lets you use ORACLE SQL QUERY syntax
out of box. Later, Jason Cater (jcater) said that query 
syntax was not the main problem - my big 
hangup is 1) their triggers are differnt than oracle's.","2002-06-29","36"
"1145","467","2","Derek said he had been really impressed with the 
sense of community that was developing around the SAP-DB now that it 
was available under the GPL (GNU Public License) - 
someone was trying to start a user group -
and i said they really needed a good sap portal with tutorials, articles, 
howto's, samples etc - the SAP guy responded and gave url to a wiki we 
could use (me doenst like wiki, so sue me) - and said he wished sap would 
do something better, but it was resources issues and policy wouldnt let 
them give access to anyone outside sap to making pages - but then within 
12 hours someone had created 
a portal (postnuke i think) from the thread at 
http://www.joinedforce.nl/sapdb/.
Jason said it was not bad for something that 
was put up today. This inspired him to ask whether SAP had a 
sample database in the same way that Oracle did. Derek said he was 
pretty darn sure they do (a large one 
iirc). Jason suggested writing some sample GNUe Forms to run 
against the SAP-DB sample database.","2002-06-29","36"
"1146","468","1","Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) reported finally 
have fixed readonly entry input bug!!! Later, Derek Neighbors
(dneighbo) noted imho readonly fields should work 
as follows - when you are in 'data' mode (normal operations) you should not be 
able to enter data into them, and preferably they would not be part of the tab 
order - if you are in 'prepare query' mode they would allow entry (for searching 
purposes) and preferably would become part of the tab order. 
James Thompson (jamest) confirmed that's how they 
worked last I knew. Derek said there was 
bug filed - a readonly widget behaves oddly... i.e. if you go to a readonly 
field in 'normal' mode it woudl let you type but what you typed would randomly 
appear in other widgets. Arturas confirmed he had updated CVS to fix 
this, and it still worked the way Derek said - you 
can enter data in readonly entry in query mode - you can not enter data in 
readonly entry in data mode (message box pops up and says ""You can't do this 
blah-blah"") - in query mode readonly entries are part of tab order.","2002-05-31","36"
"1147","469","1","Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) noted that the Windows 
binary forms snapshot is build with defaultencoding 
set to ascii is it possible to change it somehow after installation? 
James Thompson (jamest) said that there was a 
gnue.conf option now for database encoding. Dmitry said he was talking 
about the python getdefaultencoding(), which was not checked again after
python startup process. He found the code 
in the site.py module that was setting this, and suggested changing the 
source code, as he could not find a way to chande 
defaultencoding later. James agreed - we'd 
have to just add that to our build instructions for win32 - and I don't see how 
it'd break anything.","2002-05-31","36"
"1148","469","2","Dmitry asked is it hard to rebuild? i'd like to 
test it. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said that the windows installer 
used mcmillan and 
inno, as previously discussed in

James confirmed that there is a text file giving 
step by step instructions on how to do it - if you wanted to compile 
ODBC support in as well, you needed the ODBC drivers too - 
it's from activestate IIRC.","2002-05-31","36"

"1150","470","1","James Thompson (jamest) asked i 
need to mark records for delete from a trigger - what would 
people feel is the best way to make this work? 
After some discussion, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) felt 
/me doesnt like the logic of 
'marking' in code as transactions (commit/rollback) etc
shouldnt distinguish - a rollback should roll back 
everything since the last commit, whether it was an insert, 
update or delete - it shoudl 
not be something developer worries about in the detail. 
Jason Cater (jcater) asked why are 
you playing with transactions? Derek said 
well to me 'commit' implies transaction - 
even if its at form level and not db level. After 
some more discussion, Jason said so, 
in a nutshell, you are saying use block.delete() instead of 
block.markForDelete() ? which I would tend to agree 
with.","2002-05-31","36"
"1151","471","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked do you think 
that make modal windows from xml files woud be: a) a good idea. b) 
possible? Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he 
would like to maybe see them like 'wizards' 
in reporter i.e. easy for users to make new ones - but not really just xml 
files. However, it depended how complex 
of a modal box you are looking for - more 
often than not they will be done via triggers. Marcos said 
we thought that xml files would be great, because we 
already know how to handle those. Derek 
generally doesnt see modal boxes as being data 
driven nor having widgets really. Marcos said 
I guess what we'll need more are input modal windows, 
ones that just makes a question to the user and that value is teturned to the 
main form. Derek gave some examples - 1. 
is a search dialog - 2. is a picker dialog. Marcos added 
3. data input, like passwd ones. This would 
be for situations after the normal login to provide extra security for
a superviso auth a non regular trabnsaction 
such as over-riding normal credit limit checking.","2002-05-31","36"
"1152","471","2","James Thompson (jamest) said i wouldn't 
want to have to define windows - but I think i'd be ok with a trigger

think we'd want to start laying out lots of window defs in the xml. 
Derek feared it would be UGLY to have to 
create with triggers and emphasised im 
not saying it has to be xml layout. James noted that 
the search/picker is planned - it 
would be standard Forms functionality that could be called 
in the sql statement - and it creates the 
picker.","2002-05-31","36"
"1153","471","3","Derek said tha if lots of people start 
wanting different modals - want to 'enhance' modify current modal 
then having these as templated definition files (whether XML or not) 
makes more sense as it keeps people out of 
core code. However, he was not sure how common this would be. 
Modals like a picker were fairly simple, but 
search, you will get 100 different ways people want that implemented. 
Marcos felt that if you give them a standar way 
to implement search and picker, I don't think they'll make another one. 
unless the ones you give are not general enought.","2002-05-31","36"
"1154","471","4","James suggested that searcher/picker

noted that the PyGreSQL ppl created 
pg.py which is a pretty impressive library but had 
had the DB-SIG compatible features added later, as opposed to 
psycopg or pypgsql which had 
been designed fomr the ground up

;-) - he was working on a README. 
He added the main maintainability (hmm) issue at

submit/approve mechanism. Derek noted the status 
items and some other things are on each tool/package page as well as on the 
page the item belongs (like status) - is that being typed twice?

like the getSequence etc. in the postgres 
driver. James Thompson (jamest) said that there was already code 
for Trigger Exposure - you'll see a dictionary 
that contains exposed function names for the triggernamespace.
self._triggerFunctions has an entry for the sequence functoin that 
calls a functoin that then uses the triggerExtension. 
Jan said this meant that if I add functions to 
triggerExtensions they won't be added to the triggernamespace 
automaticaly.. James claimed that 
triggerExtensions are old school :) but 
admitted they still have a place. 
He pointed to some similar code he had written. Jan said he 
could add an entry to self._triggerFunctions 
... and even make it global, but what do you think is the best 
place and name for a function that calls the call function of one 
instance? James said it should search the 
loaded drivers triggerExtensions for a call method entry and if it existed it 
could call it - and if it didn't exist then it could throw a not supported by 
backend error (or something).","2002-06-02","36"

can the currentRecord by dts.getRecord(dts.getRecordNumber()). 
James said he had tried something similar, but had not been able to 
get it to work consistantly, so added the

Derek Neighbors (derek) said its 
not all that different as of time of writing, but 
it depends on your interest in 
gnue. If you are just wanting quick eval and end user 
perspective stick with release. If you want to be more 'active'
then i would take cvs. If you are on windows i would take 
release. Jason Cater (jcater) said that CVS was fairly stable as of

To install CVS once it was downloaded,

is worth doing but he would not stop Daniel if he was interested. 
Daniel said well it lets me play with xml

"1178","485","1","John Lenton (Chipaca) said that the papo project team were trying 
to get the dbsig drivers to work wrt primary

and we've stumbled over something that'll break 
backwards compatibility if we fix it - and it's a pain if we don't (because 
we'll have to check the type of the return value of a function, to start 
with). Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
thats ok we have a rule here anyhow it says
""You cant fix something unless you break two of something else.""
John said actually, it wouldn't break anything,

except postgres would stop working - which is fine by me!.","2002-07-07","37"
"1179","485","2","Jason Cater (jcater) asked so what is the 
fix/breakage? John said in dbsig, you 
see if the dbdriver has a string called primary key, and you use that as 
the name of the column that has the primary key - that breaks on one table 
when you have multiple primary keys. Jason said that the 
PrimaryIdField was not necessarily the primary key, just a way of 
identifying a particular row in a table to update. John agreed - 
it could be for example in postgres the 
oid. However, the trouble we ran into 
was when inserting a row that has an autogenerated primary key - we 
couldn't find out the oid of the row. Jason said he wanted 
to petition the DB-SIG group to add that 
functionality i.e., we can get the OID (or RowID, etc) of any inserted 
rows - but that doesn't solve the immediate need. He had 
recently added primary key lookup functions 
to the postgresql drivers in the meantime.","2002-07-07","37"
"1180","485","3","John agreed, but noted that the temporary solution using primary 
keys would mean that the thing we've got to 
return from PrimaryIdField is no longer a string, but rather a 
hash. This was because because, if 
you remember, we're working on getting multiple tables working...
...so we have several primary keys in several tables - if not, we'd've 
done ""a, b, c"".split("", "") and retained backwards compat. 
Jason agreed - I see where you guys are 
going, adding just create a trouble 
ticket saying the other ones might be broken. He said 
/me thinks the only other driver to use 
PrimaryIdField is Oracle - and I'll fix it quickly if it breaks
as I use it.","2002-07-07","37"

on forms like that i used to create a named

separate as i like to work in sizeable 
chunks, but im open to debate 
though. Jan said he would not even mind having each table

Derek agreed - in fact for designer and 
some other things i almost would like to have it go off the

was actually in the database - but 
thats another discussion. He saw 
this functionality as being important

placed. Jan wondered whether if we do it 
that way, is <schema> still the right name for the root tag?
Jason thought so, as to me required datasets 
are still part of a schema definition. Jan said that he would 
like to use this format as a dump format for 
the appserver as well, and asked would 
you object to put ""non-required"" datasets into it?. Jason said

should I implement it @

Jason Cater (jcater) suggested gfscrollbar,

there should already be a gfscrollbar

is, but is a litlle... uh, spartan :)","2002-07-11","38"
"1198","496","2","Marcos asked are 
events and triggers the same? I'm a little confused...
James said that events 
== events internal to forms - button clicks, requests for next record, 
etc, etc whereas triggers == chunks 
of code that are attached to certain ""trigger events"" that are specified 
in the gfd, grd, etc files - pre-commit, pre-update, etc, etc. 
Marcos asked how are events handled by 
gfobjects? hacking the dispatchEvent function? James explained 
objects registers with other objects to 
listen to events via a registerListener functoin IIRC - trigger events 
are hard coded into the program. Marcos said he would 
need new 'events' on gfscrollbar [...] like 
'scrollUp' event, which should do something.. James said 
there is a dictionary of events in the 
objects that listen for them - you can look at either GFForm or GFInstance 
for example. He explained you create 
a entry that maps an event to a specifc handler function - and that's 
it.","2002-07-11","38"
"1199","496","3","Later, Marcos asked how do I bind a 
function to a event? thru a eventHandler? James gave an 
example in the GFInstance.py code. Marcos asked whether this meant, 
if he wanted a GNUe Forms scrollbar (gfsb) to 
have events, I just write the functions that handle the events and then 
register them to listen to the new events? events are global?
James said events are only passed to 
objects that request to listen to events - so not really global
Marcos said yeah, but I mean 'global' in the 
sense that anyone can listen to certain event... or I'm misunderstandin 
what events are for. I what the UIsb to call the GFsb's 'event' 
handler... Jason interjected that the intent was 
so UI* doesn't have to know about GF* internals, 
and vice versa, but had to run before he could explain further. 
Marcos asked would you say that calling gfsb 
functions from uisb is bad? James said 
yes - all that should be passed via 
events. Marcos asked which is the 
difference between calling self._eventHandler and dispatchEvent? 
James said you wnat to use dispatchEvent
99.9% of the time - that sends the event to the objects that have 
registered to listen to it. Marcos noted that 
most of the examples use the other 
one... James said sigh, maybe 
someone changed something. However, 
I'm pretty sure you'd want to use 
dispatchEvent to send the actual events. Marcos asked
ok, suppose I dispatch the event. how 
do I say the certain func in gfsb is listening? call to 
registereventlistener in gfsb's constructor?. Jason 
confirmed this.","2002-07-11","38"
"1200","496","4","
Some days later, Marcos said he was still having issues with events. 
He was trying to put behaviour on {gf,ui}scrollbar - 
so, I want to make the uisb send a n event that the gfsb is listening to. 
James asked have you happened to look at UIButton 
in the wx driver? it maps a wx event to a GF event. Marcos noted that 
it uses self._eventHandler instead of dispatchEvent. 
I was told to use the latter.... James looked, and said 
this doesn't work like I remember it, 
although it appeared the confusion comes from some 
of this being wxpython ""events"" and some of this being gnue ""events"". 
He explained in the button code you've got 
EVT_BUTTON() which sets the function to call when the user generates a wx button 
click - then the next line containing the (event.eventHandler) is pushing the 
mouse and UI event handlers onto the wx event processing stack. We used to have 
every widget contain the duplicate code for this IIRC. The reason we're passing 
that event.eventHandler in is that those classes (mouse and UI event) dont 
register as event aware.","2002-07-11","38"
"1201","496","5","Marcos asked how do I tell that ceratin gfsb's 
method should be called? James said that's 
mapped in the GFInstance - all events are processed thru there as sort of a 
clearing house - so you'd setup a funciton in there that did the approprate calls 
to the lower level gfobjects. You'd set your uiscrollbar to process certain events 
like button does with EVT_BUTTON( - there it sets it up so that it's own 
self.buttonHandler gets called when an event button is pressed - it then uses 
_setDefaultEventHandlers to shove the standard event handler 
classes for mouse and keyboard support onto it's event processor stack.
The alternative, but non-standard, way would be register the handlers directly, 
which will generate a GNUE Event that is picked up 
by GFInstance. He noted its is prefectly 
OK for GFInstance to just ignore the event if it determines the state of the 
form is such that the event should not be honored, and remarked 
all key presses are passed back to the form for 
processing prior to the UI changing - so if I enter a lowercase a and the field 
is set to case=""upper"" then the GFInstance and friends insert an uppercase A 
instead then tell the UI to update - it also does the focusing.","2002-07-11","38"
"1202","496","6","He also said you'll notice a lot of events are 
named requestFOO - because the UI is a slave to the GNUe Forms (GF) 
tree - it can make requests from the GF tree but 
it's not allowed to update it's own contents w/o getting events back from the 
GF tree - it's not allowed to change focus with events from the GF tree - 
it's a complete mindless slave to the GF tree humbly requesting that something 
be done then waiting until it's told to do something. This was 
so that we had a single code base that handled 
things like max length, input masks, uppercase conversion, etc, etc - 
i didn't want to see each UI implement things in their own fashion, 
as UI (User Interface) independance was an important goal of GNUe Forms.","2002-07-11","38"
"1203","496","7","Marcos asked would you say that I should 
'build' a new event, like requestSCROLL?. James said 
oh yes, new events would probably be 
required - event name are hardcoded in gfinstance yes. If we allow UI 
plug-ins in the future we'll need some way to register them - but everything 
so far is pretty much std behaviour so I'm not too worried about the hard

understood the problem, in that localised month names in queries were 
causing errors, I just don't agree with the

working properly, it needed to be changed, not by-passed. Arturas agreed - 
i changed it so that now it gives fixed 
'YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND' format not the localised one. 
The dropping of the decimals for seconds was a slightly different issue,

possible solution ""mm/dd/yy"" for internal representation - /me 
goes and finds a shotgun to preform some reeducation. He 
declared that the one true date format is 
""YYYY-MM-DD"" and noted that the proposed format was
not y2k compliant, it's ambigious with the 
european ""dd/mm/yy""' John Lenton (Chipaca) said that dd/mm/yy 
was not so much European as

Two days later, Perry asked can anyone tell me 
why (At least in the KC) it was agreed to use ""mm/dd/yy""? for internal date 
formats? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested 
probably because of the unhealthy american 
influence. Perry said yyyy-mm-dd seems 
to be a much more logical system to use - theres even a ISO standard about 
it. Andrew certainly prefers it - 
makes sorting in a list much simpler. Perry suggested 
well, if american's persist to use their silly 
systems we'll have to buy a few plane tickets and go and beat them around the 
head with a large, wet, and slightly smelly trout. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) vigorously countered um cause americans 
are the best - and we dont want your puking metric system or messed up concept 
of date formatting - you can even take your stinking celsius too. 
Perry goes and prepares the fish, before 
Derek quickly clarified btw im completely 
kidding - only the french would use that as a reason ;) I mean after the 
dateline was stolen from them, who would blame them for their ire.","2002-07-11","38"

yes, because pgsql.xsl is the only one which

pgsql.xsl is the only one which can create insert

"1212","502","1","Perry Lorier (Remosi) reprised his 
amazing .so->idl idea, as previously 
discussed in 
.
You know how nm can tell you all the symbols in 
a .so (or .o for that matter) right? and how ""stabs"" can tell you the type 
of a symbol if it was compiled with -g, or, alternatively, c++filt will tell 
you if it was compiled using gcc, right? :) Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said he had never used that 
before - he asked is c++filt 
apt-gettable? Perry said it's in 
binutils. givin that type information you 
should be able to write an idl file (for gnurpc for instance).
He recognised that you need to of course figure 
out which symbols are actually defined in the .so/.a/.o that you're linking - 
but it could be a really easy way to automatically load, say, openssl into 
python. You could take the openssl.so file generate some idl for it, then use 
gnurpc to use openssl as if it was a python module without having to spend 
ages defining all the normal glue logic. If you did it right python could 
catch the import function and do all of that automatically - so you could 
have a .so (eg openssl.so) and then just go ""import openssl"" in python and 
have it do all the work for you ;). Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt
this also may open up licensing holes :)
Perry agreed - but so does allowing multiple .c 
files in a gcc invocation :).","2002-07-13","38"

differences between german and american accounting. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said he did not know - 
from what i understand american accounting 
serves a different purpose - read: austrian/german accounting is done mainly 
to satisfy the tax authority and to calculate the taxes to pay, whereas 
us american accounting seems to me to 
replace what we have in german ""controlling"" or ""kostenrechnung"" as well 
i.e. it serves as a source of information for the management and/or the 
investors. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked if that meant 
american accounting is just a kind of GuV ?
GuV = Gewinn & Verlust Rechnung ( don't know the english 
equivalence). ""Profit and 
Loss calculation,"" as far as I can tell. Reinhard said 
i would believe us accounting does _more_ 
than german accounting - sometimes i also get the feeling that us accounting 
doesn't have the strict concept of systematic account numbers. 
Jan said hmmm, I thought german accounting would 
allready be kind of too much (especial for lasy students who have to understand 
it ;) ). Reinhard said that US accounting seemed to be more detailed
(at least that is my understanding) - 
they do ""kostenstellen"" and ""kostenarten"" and ""kostenträger"" etc. all in 
accounting Cost accounting and/or 
management accounting?  as far 
as I can tell - although i could misunderstand that.","2002-07-13","38"

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said in some ways 
dcl isnt even on real 'version' numbers so releasing it to bugtraq seems 
kind of odd - but there are people using it in production so its understandable 
i guess. He had found bugtraq really 
great to work with - provided samples of how to exploit - and gave us a month 
before releasing publicly so we could fix. Perry felt that 
php is a b'stard of a thing to get secure. 
Derek said it was a catch 22 - i wanted to notify 
all dcl users immediately BUT to do so 'overly' publicly would be remiss as no 
patch was available. Perry agreed - you have 
to patch the hole first :) - and by the email it sounds like that there were 
serveral :) Derek said well i did say in

say what they were until i had committed the fix for each one. Then bundled when 
all were done and did full blow release to freshmeat, all announce lists and

i think was fair.","2002-07-14","38"
"1216","505","1","Federico Heinz (perlhead) asked Any pointer 
on where forms gets its fonts? He found the 
font is hideously large. And the encoding is not ISO-8859-1, which sucks 
too. He noted that the gnue.conf had a setting to choose monospaced 
or proportional fonts, but the comment in the file stated 
# Normally, default font style and size is used, 
according to the active theme - But it doesn't mention which ""theme"" we're 
talking about. It sure doesn't use my gtk theme's settings...
Jason Cater (jcater) said you probably wanna change 
pointSize=10 (or so) in your gnue.conf - somehow the default was increased and 
got passed us the last release. Federico pointed out that 
gnue.conf says pointSize is for fixed with 
only... Jason said he didn't know forms worked 
properly w/o fixed width fonts - I haven't tested it that way. 
Federico reported It worked for the size.
He felt The comments in gnue.conf are misleading 
as they gave the impression that the default is 
fixedWidthFont=0. Jason agreed and said /me 
will change that.","2002-07-14","38"

I'm executing begins with ""<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""ISO-8859-1""?>""

ones. He suspected it's because forms is picking 
a font with the wrong encoding... but I can't find out which. He went off 
to check.","2002-07-14","38"
"1218","505","3","
Two days later, Federico reported by 
fiddling in the forms source, I fixed my encoding problem!
He had added ISO-8859-1 as an option to the widget.SetFont 
parameters - It seems the problem is 
that wx (or the python wx bindings, or *something*) does not get the 
encoding right unless you force it. Arturas Kriukovas 
(Arturas) confirmed about a 3 days ago 
this was fixed in CVS - was 
added option in gnue.conf. Marcos Dione (StyXman) confirmed 
that Project papo was currently using its own forked CVS -
I'll tell our cvsmaster to sync if he 
finds it suitable... The reason for the fork was 
we are hacking some things we need into 
gnue, but we can't send patches yet because we hadn't give the 
copyright to gnu yet. So, we 'forked' till we cand send our 
'improvements' to the gnue's guys. Federico wondered 
whether there was a need for a further gnue.conf option - 
The configuration file site.py has 
an ""encoding"" option, which would work pretty well for 
this.. Arturas pointed out that this 
encoding option is for database, 
not the Forms client display.","2002-07-14","38"

me, sort of, adding

an entity that must be further referenced must be defined as <!ENTITY % 
foo ""bar""> and not <!ENTITY foo ""bar""> - 3) %true and %false are 
declared AFTER %boolean. Jason said he was 
wondering about #2 - as the sample dtd's I was learning from didn't have 
them - but other ones I saw later did have them. He committed 
some fixes. Ariel said that the first problem was not only affecting 
emacs but also sabcmd - 
when i run sabcmd with pgsql.xsl to get a 
.sql batch file it complaints about nested comments. He confirmed
that changhing all the minuses with pluses 
will work.. He felt that compatability with emacs' XML mode was 
important, since until we have a working 
designer for schemas the best way to write xml documents is using emacs.
and if you want from emacs all the nice features like inserting the elements 
semi-automatically you have to specify the DOCTYPE (i.e the dtd) in the xml

is an example of that :) What im seeing packages lacking is they can 
do one or the other but not both - i.e. you can get ok cheaper 
manufacturing packages but they dont do any retail or 
more importanting shipping stuff - or you can get a quickbooks/peachtree 
for cheap that does retail ok but wont let you manage the manufacturing 
side. I see the 'inventory problem' and the 'shipping problem' as the 
two areas where gnue can kick arse fast. Stuart Quimby

"1221","507","2","Derek asked What im wondering is should 
inventory be separate tables for manufacturing and distribution - i.e. 
have inventory tables for the the 'components' you use to manufacture
and inventory tables for the 'products' you sell or distribute.
Stuart did not see the need for that - inv 
is inv. Derek said this matched the 
quick talks i have had with others, but 
for me im seeing some disconnect - 
im thinking you have inventory that use to 'build' - 
then you have an 'allocation' table that says you need xyz components 
to make product A. Stuart said he used a Bill of Materials 
(BOM) table for that - very simple structure
- highly self referential. He noted *any* 
package that has a bom will do that - it's just implemented badly, 
usually. Derek said i think i might 
see the light as to it being all one structure - its just a matter of the 
'allocation' table - that says what things in inventory are needed to make 
product A. Things could get more complicated if manufactured 
products were then used as the basis for other manufactured products. 
Stuart said that his own database handled this - 
it's *very* simple structure with 
just 3 fields, Assmemb, Part, Qty 
but you can handle *any* situation with 
that - an Assemb. can also be a Part - so that way you build up

likely make it less print-shop orientated and more

Some days later, Peter Sullivan (psu) asked 
do you think that your new tech

My thought process on the tech notes: it takes time for us 
to open up tech references using XXXX editor, figure out where 
something we're working on internally should go (or even if it 
should), and then work it into the existing structure - 
but I can whip up a tech note on something i am doing in 5 min

properly. /me sees technotes used a lot. Plus we could put 
really internal stuff in there that probably has no business

getting close to really needing some 
hacker talent to build a functional contact and donor management 
system. They hoped to make 
something other non-profits could find useful.
Jason Cater (jcater) noted thta Derek Neighbors had been 
working on such a beast.
He himself had been writing a 
Rental Property management app using our tools - and it is a 
piece of cake - the biggest problem I have is defining exactly 
what I want. He would release this as a GNUe 
application - if not official gnue, 
at least ""endorsed"" and free :). Bradley said 
cool.  It would be good to see some 
apps out there  that  use the tools. Jason agreed -
that's our biggest problem - 
Both jamest and I (we're the main forms, reports, and designer 
coders) use GNUe extensively at work - so we know what it can do -
but until we get some real-world apps out it's hard to explain 
to people exactly what we are capable of.","2002-07-17","39"
"1228","511","2","Bradley asked BTW, your forms 
library can have multiple interface generators right?
Jason confirmed this - GTK / Win32 is 
well supported - Curses / KDE / HTML started, but not 
completed, adding at this 
stage, we are really need-driven - so if there's a need, it gets 
coded - (we consider FSF a ""need"" :).","2002-07-17","39"
"1229","511","3","Bradley said that the FSF had already done 
a data analysis. RMS is pushing us to do a simple hack so that we 
don't need to spend much staff time on it, which would be sad, 
because I know the GNUe stuff could get us something really nice.
So my hope is to find volunteers who can help so we can spend 
minimal staff time, and get something nice for FSF and the world -- 
instead of something ""barely adequate"" for just FSF. 
Jason said In all honesty, using GNUe 
would probably be even quicker than a quick hack - the trouble 
is getting ppl started on it. Bradley agreed - 
Any suggestions to get people started?  
What can FSF do to spur things on? Jason said his 
view was we should do one or two USABLE 
and USEFUL screens that you could start using right away - 
this would accomplish several things: 1. Show that GNUe is capable 
of what you need - 2. Get your users acquanted (and get feedback - 
positive or negative - from their viewpoint) 3. Give your staff 
(if they are going to help us do your project) example forms to 
work from.","2002-07-17","39"
"1230","511","4","Bradley said one major issue would be importing and merging 
the data - we have existing data in a 
really shitty format that is big. To make the system useful right 
off, it needs to have the imported data. This was 
a big text file that is transaction, not 
""contact"" oriented. So, if you bought things /donated from FSF twice 
in the last five years, we'd have you in twice, likely with slightly 
different entries. He might be able to get some sample data, 
although I have to check that my  
script that removes sensative data works without fail. 
At the moment, the data was maintained in A 
hacked together Emacs Lisp application. He expected that 
The import process would have to be user 
directed. but If we can get to the 
point where we have a good table layout, we could do that in 
house - asking the user: ""Are these 
two transactions actually refering to the same person?"".","2002-07-17","39"

a problem with working to deadlines, but was more concerned about 
starting from the data elements - thats 
how a hacker does it - im a business analyst - i want to talk to the

however, we don't have a ton of time for 
needs analysis and a good deal of work had already been done 
internally on this. Derek said he had already had some discussions, 
and some of the needs weren't full 
developed (i.e. the questioning needed to go further).
Bradley said I really invision doing 
something that can do some basic things, and then improving over 
time with more needs analysis, user wishlist s, etc.
Derek agreed - basic contact data - 
then build more.","2002-07-17","39"
"1232","511","6","However, his contacts at FSF had been talking about much 
more complex data analysis - i.e. 
pulling up a company and trying to view the employees of that company
- by region - by name - and how important was it to manage 'companies' 
as well as 'people'. Bradley agreed - one 
of the biggest things Ravi needs is being able to tell the difference 
between ""This company donates, and this is our contact there"" vs. ""this 
person donates, and they happen to work at a company"" - right now, we 
have no clue to tell the difference and they really needed to 
be able to do both. Derek said he had already mocked up some 
possible data layouts working with postgres 
with the DCL contact data (iirc). He suggested 
i am thinking maybe i just get the data spec 
completely done and reviewed by the end users - 
then perhaps you all could provide me with 
a copy of the existing data store - and i can work on pushing the data 
into it (unless you all would rather do that) -  but im thinking just 
looking at the data and attempting to map it on even conceptional level
will give me MUCH greater insight as to what you are tracking
and will prompt me with LOTS of questoins for end users about 
how they would expect to handle different business scenarios. 
Bradley agreed, but said we do need a way for 
a user-directed data cleanup and we 
don't want to focus too much on what we are tracking now, becaues our 
whole current tracking doesn't work for what the organization needs to be 
doing. We have an opportunity to do it right from scratch, becaues there 
is really NOTHING there now.  Just a big honking text file.","2002-07-17","39"

our GPL Compliance guy has a system that will grok copryight.list into an SQL 
databse. He had some security concerns with 
merging these two databases. We have anonymous donors, etc. Derek 
said that RBAC = Role Based Access Control 
should handle that, but Bradley was not fully convinced. However, he noted 
we just need to get a donor managment system running 
first.  ;) Derek agreed - it was more a personal convenience issue that

"1234","512","1","Further to 
, 
Marcos Dione (StyXman) queried why he had to 
declare a default behaviour 
in GFInstance, but then I override it 
in gfsb. He wondered if I do 
self._eventHandler (event) in the wx's event handler, am I not 
skipping the whole event mechanism? Jason Cater (jcater) 
thinks GFInstance provides the handler
- not the default handler. Marcos said that his wx 
scrollbar widget was so specific that 
I'm rather reluctant to put it in gfinstance... 
It would scroll the 'current;' 
datasource - where current is the datasource associated to the 
block in which the sb is declared. Jason thought this 
sounded fine. Marcos said that, ideally, I 
would put a dummy behaviour in gfinstance and the real behaviour in GFsb
- because I prefer to keep the ui/gf relation tight - 
but, it's your design.","2002-07-18","39"
"1235","512","2","
Some days later, Marcos said he still did not feel comfortable 
putting the behaviour for a scrollbar in 
the gfinstance 'multpiplexor'... rather than the GFScrollBar
module. Jason explained you need a single 
controller monitoring behavior - it's next to impossible to keep 
track of the ""current"" scrollbar and catch it's GFEvents exclusively - 
i.e., if you have all GFScrollBars listen in on the events 
then you have to distinguish which one should actually respond. 
Marcos said he thought there was a link 
between the uiobj and the gfobl, and that way the behaviour could go 
directly in the gfobj - and I have some problems cause I think I'll 
get some circular event launching. The behaviout I want to give to the 
sb is to scroll the current block datasource. So, when the 'cursor' of 
the datasource changes, the sb should change, and vice versa...
Jason agreed - that's why I think you can't do 
it within the GFScrollbar code - or you at least have to multiplex the 
request through GFInstance. The GFDisplayHandler uses the multiplexing 
route. So, there are two things you can do: 1) Have GFInstance handle it 
all (easiest) - 2) Have GFInstance listen for the requestSCROLLBAR event 
and then determines which scrollbar/datasource is the current one, and 
directly call a method of this scrollbar which then handles the 
logic. Either way, you really can't 
have GFScrollbar listening for the events - as all the Scrollbars in the 
form would get the event. Most Forms widgets used the first 
method but the GFDisplayHandler (keystrokes, et 
al) use #2 - the only reason GFDisplayHandler is different is that each 
entry widget can have a different *type* of displayhandler.","2002-07-18","39"
"1236","512","3","Marcos noted that in UIbutton's 
buttonHAndler this was done by a call 
to _eventHandler instead of 'raising' a event. Jason was not 
conviced that UIbutton was a good model - it worked that way 
only because UIbutton doesn't have its own 
dispatchEvent, which was the more standard way of handling 
this - search for  event.eventHandler = 
self.dispatchEvent. Marcos said things were becoming 
_a little_ clear now....","2002-07-18","39"
"1237","512","4","Marcos asked how do I 'hook' a new 
listener to certain event? I need to know when the datasource does 
something with the visible records... with 
registerEventListeners? Jason agreed - 
you will need to hook into GFBlock
(add some code there). Marcos confirmed 
like, doing a special event just for a 
ocassional scrollbar?.","2002-07-18","39"
"1238","512","5","Later, he uncovered another problem - 
I added a method on gfblock that 
registers scrollbars.\ a scroll bar created registers itself as

Bajusz Tamás (btami) asked for some 
help on xml2sql - i try to make a firebird.xsl but was 
having problems with the tags for Primary Keys. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said the ""correct"" way will 
be <pkfield name=""username""/> - the old-style is from the 
scripts used in DCL - but they have a few GObject no-no's in them 
so the one in GNUe cvs will have to be the new style.

"1240","514","1","Jason Cater (jcater) announced I have completed 
my masterpiece - Designer will never be the same again. The 
wizard/template/scripting support in Designer has been taken one step 
further - all ""Creation Actions"" in Designer are now implemented (or once 
all are converted) as Scripts[wizards] - so people can extend the 
functionality of Designer without knowing Designer internals
by creating Plug-Ins. All basic actions in Designer will be done via 
plug-ins too, so people can replace the default functionality with their 
own support. He felt this was a huge step 
in the life of designer. Peter Sullivan (psu) asked 
does this also pave the way for Designer to 
move beyond being ""just"" a Forms Designer to the sunlit uplands of Reports 
Designer, App Server Designer, etc? Jason said 
we've already started that - that's part of this 
cvs breakage since last release. We have the starts of a Navigator designer
- we do have a Schema designer - HOWEVER - right now, only the Wizards work
(i.e., you can use Designer to extract table definitions from, say, Postgres 
and save them in the GNUe Schema format). He had re-engineered 
Designer so that all the code that was specific to designing forms was 
now separated out into a specific module.","2002-07-18","39"

Three days later, 
Jason Cater (jcater) predicted designer's 
about to kick some serious arse - by the end of the day, ""insert a 
dropdown entry"" (using my nifty new plugin architecture) will 
autocreate any needed datasources. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo)
suggested i think the marketing materials 
can say 'Designer: The Ultimate Arse Kicker' and it wont be a lie 
:) Jason worked some more on the non-stable CVS code base, 
managing to bring down X at least once, but felt it was coming 
along nicely. He accidently pasted some code in the main channel, but 
explained that is an example of a plugin
- a completely working plugin - that creates a basic entry. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked so 
you're gutting & rewriting large chunks of code? 
Jason said not really - 
designer hasn't really done much in the way of ""creating things""
i.e., it excels at moving crap around but the creation stuff is 
lacking until this latest re-write.","2002-07-18","39"
"1242","514","3","He added /me isn't all that gung-ho about 
plug-ins in general but I'm trying to make it easier for others to 
contribute - iow, /me wants to make it so you can add features to 
designer without fully understanding what goes on behind the 
scenes. Derek was not sure that was a good idea - 
dont know what you are doing - 
thats ok we will let you break it anyways -  especially 
with him around. Jason said my main goal 
is to NOT be the only one contributing to Designer :) - /me 
has even scared jamest out of designer so I'm all alone in there
and it's a lonely place to be. Derek agreed - 
all kidding a side i think its an 
excellent move - reminds me of delphi :) - i.e. we will give you 
the shell, beat the hell out of it at will. 
He really wants to look at cvs 
integration tools so that can 
check/in/out files and such from within designer - not full cvs 
client or anything - but some stuff.","2002-07-18","39"

The next day, Bajusz Tamás (btami) reported

The next day, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked did 
you have a look at the schema creation wizard I've added? Jason 
said yeah - just committed a patch to it
so it will write out to a file - pretty cool, though. He added 
of course, that's why I like a plug-in architecture - 
as I would have never thougth about doing something like that - 
but it's a great addition. Jan asked 
how can I create new instances out of a 
wizard?. Jason thought he would probably 
need to add a convenience method to do that - as it is easy to do if you 
can get at the Designer.py instance but getting that far back would be ugly
(something I want to hide from plug-in writers). Jan suggested 
adding a link to the designer instance to 
start(...) ? or, (this could be easier) to create a wizard._MainInstance

"1245","515","1","Ariel Calò (ariel_) said i think 
you sould add some methods to geasList - canonical things on 
lists, like getLenght isEmpty, isFirst(geasItem) isLast(geasItem) 
previousItem - the last if _resultset allows to. I think they 
should be simple calls to the cooresponding methods in ResultSet. 
By the way what is the difference between ResultSet and 
RecordSet? Jan Ischebeck (siesel) explained
Resultset = result of an select 
operation - RecordSet = one row.. Ariel said 
I don't know if such methods are specified 
someway in ODMG, if so you can follow their spec. Jan 
said I will add these methods (if 
possible) - ODMG use a different approach, because you get a 
collection, which can be a Set, Bag, List .... (like in 
java) - in the end I like to use something similar like ODMG, 
java, something that is supporting locking and which is 
thread/multi client safe. But I still don't know the best way to 
do that. Another important point is that it has to be easy to 
implement, and easy to understand. Ariel asked whether 
there would be some kind of caching 
mechanism (for long long long lists) or it is yet implemented in 
resultset?. Jan said there is 
kind of caching in result set, but not in the 
dbdriver...","2002-07-21","39"
"1246","516","1","It was asked how to install the GNU 
Enterprise tools on Windows 2000. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
pointed to 
http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads, saying 
for eval purposes, ignore ""snapshots"" 
and ""prereleases"". He believed that 
the windows binaries already contain 
everything needed for running the gnu enterprise tools 
:), including setting up menu entries and desktop icons.
with designer, you create forms and code. 
""forms"", the program itself, interprets these forms, displays them 
and handles the database resp. application server 
connection. The .gfd (GNUe Forms Definition) files 
produced by Designer were xml based 
markup - gnue makes heavy use of xml: markup for forms definition, 
reports definition etc. To connect to a database, 
you have a connections.conf file where 
you have to specify the host, db name and database driver 
- you could have multiple connections. To see how to design 
simple forms, a good starting point is 
the zipcode example. my first running gnu enterprise app was done 
with that :). Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) confirmed there 
was a sample entry for an Oracle database in the default 
connections.conf file. Jason Cater (jcater) pointed out that 
unfortunately, the precompiled win32 
exe's won't support oracle - as to create the exe's, we'd have to 
include the Oracle run-times and of course, that is a big licensing 
no-no :(. Jan said alternatively you 
can build it from source. i don't know how hard it is to make the 
oracle driver work. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) confirmed 
that Forms could support grid-like layouts - 
grid in forms is done by giving a 
counter to a widget - that means that you have an entry and set the 
counter to 10 then you have the entry 10 times below each other. 
I would believe that designer supports this but i'm not 
sure.","2002-07-21","39"

is leading the way in NOLA conversion. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) announced we have at least 
2 companies committed to using GNUe in a manufacturing setting - 
specifically BOM, Invoicing, Inventory -

"1248","518","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) reported that Ariel Calò (ariel_) had 
proposed to add an  ""initialdrop"" attribute 
to <table> (boolean)  in the GSD file format. It would create a 
DROP TABLE statement before the CREATE TABLE command. He noted 
because creating tables will be handled by 
gnue-common (in the future)  this option won""t be needed (in the future)  
because there could be a dialog opening (in designer) which ask the user 
if he want to keep his old tables with the old data or not. 
He could imagine a future senario like that:  
using designer to create a schema definition, creating tables with this 
schema definition, by just pressing ""Create tables"" button. 
i.e. designer uses a new function in common which create tables, indexes, 
etc., if a table already exist a warning message is shown and the user 
can choose to between leaving this table alone, or to drop it and recreate 
it. In this case, there is no need for that ""initialdrop"" attribut.  
right? Jason Cater (jcater) said well
that's kind of the direction I was wanting - however I want the common 
support to be smart enough to be able to do ""alter tables"" or give the 
user the option of restarting from scratch i.e., that will be vital for 
our packaging. Jan agreed - we need 
an package format and an installer soon. The installer would use 
gnue/common to create/modify the tables defined in a GSD file.
btw. it would be cool to have a package tool in designer, where you can 
just choose some GFD, GND, GSD and build a package. Jason said 
he was working on that - (notice the new Project 
menu in Designer :) He did not have a name for the project file 
type yet - he had only implemented the Wizard 
stuff for the schema designer - haven't started on the graphical 
part. Christian Selig (sledge_) asked whether this would be 
ms-access like visual creation of tables 
with all the connected id fields? Jason said 
something like that - or 
something like pgaccess - only not pg-specific

add my VERY important ""change background color"" patch ;) 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt oh that'd 
be so hot, adding /me wants 
that!!, as gray is so 
boring. Nick Rusnov (nickr) said it needed 
to add gradient support. 
Andrew felt it was lots easier to support 
single colours - /me looks up the wxpython docs. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said yes, gray is boring
- that's why I prefer grey. Nick accused Jason of being 
entirely too boring - 
you should be full of life like siesel. Andrew noted 
ooh, there's a wxWindow.SetBackgroundColour 
method - just let 'colour' (or color if you prefer) to be an optional 
attribute of the form. Nick felt if 
you wa;nt other colours shouldhn't you use a local theme for your widget 
set like gtk or winders or whatever - shounldn't it pick up whatever 
colours the native widgets are using? Andrew felt
these UI enhancements win over the stupid 
users & management ;) Nick said he might need a 
white background as I need forms to look just 
like paper forms. Several people proposed other colour 
schemes of various levels of garishness. Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) said actually at one time we 
discussed being able to take a .eps file or such - and having it be the

we don't really have the modules/packages

At the moment, it is a classic LAMP (linux, 
apache. mysql, php) app - except it actually has a good UI. But derek 
already has some DCL forms for various admin functions in two tier (i.e. 
form talks directly to d/b). Derek said that the 
progression will be - make it use 
forms as an alternative to the 
existing php (web) interface - 
then long term as appserver gets stable
then both the php and forms versions could use the appserver - 
eventually the php version would be replaced by form www driver.

use both by the Application server and by

Later, he explained all the developers use 
cvs versions so our 'motivation' to have debs is low - and we havent been

Also, with Internet Explorer, you had to go

Anyone with authority on xml2sql,

xml2sql is really in the early stages - 
I don't think we are satisfied with its current state. 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said the 
idea of xml2sql is it will be part of common - any product with a 
gpl compatiable license may use it. I dont necessarily seeing us 
packaging it outside common - as ultimately in will be a tool too 
small in the toolbox of GNUe to segregrate out. I think the idea 
is that integrator and designer will provide solid interfaces to 
it. He asked that before more 
changes are made to .gsd that they be documented and sent to dev 
list to keep everyone involved and up-to-date.","2002-07-24","40"
"1262","525","3","Jay said he would 
like to collect multiple schemas into a composite schema.
Derek said im thinking you do this 
with includes. Jay said 
the includes could conceivably 
overlap, so the ""combinator"" would have to be smarter - 
I need a schema to be able to 
add a field. ... or one row, or a table, or an index..
Derek invisioned we would provide 
update schemas as an alternative to the full scheme for
new installs, addoing we will have 
similar issues for 'package' management. Another idea i had 
was a schema 'diff' program or updater so to speak - so if you 
have an existing schema/database and you want want it to now 
look like schema X you could run this 
compare/diff utility and it would create the schema necessary to 
do the updates. Jay said this 
is something that I very much need.
I wrote a dbdiff utility a long time ago, but it only works on 
PostgreSQL databases and has some flaws.","2002-07-24","40"
"1263","525","4","Derek suspected the first phase 
will be providing tags that do alter/drop etc which would 
allow you to have seperate schema definition files for upgrade and 
new install. Its not great because 
you have to maintain a separate update file by hand - but it provides 
upgrade mechanism - ultimately a program should be able to do 
compare 1.0.gsd to 1.1.gsd and work out the differeces for 
itself. Jay felt, based on his experience writing his own 
dbdiff utility, that there is 
no way for the database to ""know"" how to upgrade data structure 
without destroying data. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said 
you need a: GNUe schema transformation 
hint file. Jay suggested 
The hints would have to be fairly 
complex and gave some examples. He did not think 
there's a way around a tested 
upgrade script written by someone who understood the 
logic behind the changes but the diff 
utility (which prompts) is useful for 
developing on one db and publishing to another.","2002-07-24","40"
"1264","525","5","Derek said he would expect to do an upgrade script from each 
previous version to the next - if people skipped upgrades, they 
would need to simply apply the 
upgrades in succession. Jay still was not sure 
why would the upgrade be a 
.gsd? Derek said that, by adding alter/drop/add to 
the existing insert/create/update syntax in GNUe Scheme 
Definition (.gsd) files, .gsds could support both - but 
if it would make everyone feel 
warm and fuzzy to have a .gud gnue update defition 
and maintain yet ANOTHER .xsl file? he would not object, 
although he did not see any real need. Jay said 
I'm thinking that how I plan 
to use this is tainting the conversation... at this point, I 
don't care about db independence for my project.","2002-07-24","40"
"1265","525","6","Derek said to me that is only 
reason xml2sql is around (db independence) - and to 
provide a quick migration path
for converting from, say, PostgreSQL to SAP-DB. Although 
postgres is a good little database,
he was increasingly finding it has friggin 
issues - not as many as mysql but still, giving some examples 
involving type casting - which is fine if 
you only want to use postgres - but if you are doing any kind of x DB 
stuff you are hosed as its so non standard. He felt that 
from what i have seen of SAP-DB i think 
thats where its at - especially because its supported on windows 
exponentially better. It was GPL - 
so even a better license than postgres ;), with all the tools 
released under either the GNU Public License (GPL) or Lesser GNU 
Public License (LGPL). He had had a really 
good response from their developers with queries, and 
we have committment from the SAP-DB team 
to work with us on any issues we find in the python driver for 
SAP-DB. He felt from what i have 
seen SAP AG might be one of the few big boys that actually gets free 
software - i.e. SAP-DB was not a money maker for them anymore (oracle 
and mssql and db2) were always chosen instead - but they wanted to keep 
it for those customers who do use it and believed in it - 
they figured making it GPL would help draw some new blood outside SAP 
R/3 users.","2002-07-24","40"
"1266","525","7","Jay explained what he would want to use xml2sql for - 
as a way of doing a consolidated schema from a number of php files, 
each of which defined it's own 
""interface"" to the database. Derek felt 
this is outside scope of our 
toolset as gsd is mainly 
way to get cross db definitions. xml2sql could be used
to produce .gsds then write a program
that uses an xml parser to aggregrate them but 
that doesnt solve your issue. 
Jan suggested the merging of schemata s
hould be done with gnue-designer - its quite easy to add wizards,
now that support had been added for plug-ins, as discussed in 
, 
so writing a ""merge schema X wizard"" should be 
quite easy.. Even if the underlying application was in PHP, 
that doesn't mean that he cannot use a GNUe

uniqueKey/index/primaryKey, those should be the same, though. but 
all said, I just care if it works. Jan said 
I can understand why differentiating 
between index and uniq index (=primary key), but doing 2 ways of 
specifying uniq keys possibly makes programming a bit complicated

gnue will be one of python's glory projects 
soon - as well as wxWindows - we certainly abuse both of them a 
lot. Jason REALLY hopes we can 
influence DB_SIG 3.0. Derek thought this was unlikely. 
However, Jason noted read over the spec - 
DBSIG 2 is primarily for reading data i.e., non-transactional stuff - 
iow, DBSIG 2 was written to create a standard so that Zope could get a

gets nervous that we will be playing the reintroducing fixed 
bugs game i have seen in places ive worked - he would 
rather all patches were applied to the central CVS tree, 
especially as the copyright assignment issues 
i think will be resolved by weeks 
end. For the future, im not 
sure best answer going forward - as there was thought of giong to 
colonels like the linux kernel - i.e. limited cvs write access 
heads of state - and way to do things is submit patches for review
and then colonel applies them if accepted. However there are many 
practical issues with that as far as resources go.","2002-07-24","40"
"1270","528","1","Marc Lovelace (AnZaC) said he was 
lookin' to find a way to use an outside 
php script to create trouble tickets through the DCL functionality.. 
that make sense? As in, I'd like to be able to pass in all the 
information required to the function.. and let DCL run with the 
ball... Jason Cater (jcater) suggested 
look at the email gateway - 
it does just that - err, I mean as an example of what to do. 
Marc said he did not have root access, but Jason suggested 
I imagine you could set up a fetchmail 
script that runs like every 10 or so minutes that fetches mail 
from an account and pipes it into dcl-gateway.pl - that wouldn't 
require root access. This would involve setting up 
a .procmailrc and .forward file for the designated mail account.
Marc thought that might just 
work, asking any way I can 
set up the .forward file to ONLY forward email with XXXX in the 
subj? Jason thinks you'll need to 
use procmail for that, giving a sample procmail file.
Marc got qmail sending the email 
over to procmail... got the .procmailrc filtering the mail as it 
comes in... now I'm just trying to find where it put 
it..","2002-07-24","40"

The next day, Marc reported got the

w/o the module, just in case? He noted The 
rest of the script works like a charm.. I'd just like to be 
able to have a little more information inserted in the DB for the Issue

some perl cpan modules you can grab that'll break apart the mime 
message Marc said he did not have install rights on the box he 
was using - if he had, he would have installed the MIME module and solved 
the problem directly. Jason was sure you can 
install cpan modules locally. Derek said they had tried this, 
but, as Marc reported, it gave me a root 
permissions problem. Jason pointed to some information 
on the web
about installing perl modules. Marc read the information and tried it
out, but still could not install it into 
the perl directory. He concluded that his 
best bet is to stand by and 
wait for the folks who own the box to give me a response on 
installing the MIME parser....","2002-07-24","40"

inserted, then enter the data for the detail... is there some 
magical thingy i'm missing? hmmm, i see some voodoo for ""populating 
our primary key"" in one of the examples... perhaps this is what i 
need? James Thompson (jamest) confirmed 
you'll have to use a trigger to pull 
the value - our backend doesn't reload the record data after commit
so the primary key remains blank :( - this also causes issues with 
backend triggers altering data - the form doesn't reflect it. 
He gave a working example, but 
felt we really need to handle this better 
by default. Matthew said yeah 
that'd be nice.  althought i guess the trick finding a robust way to 
get the id of the record one just inserted.  MSAccess is totally broken

annoying part is having to tweak the x's and y's.  the great part about 
designer is that it produces clean xml, so that one can easily use their 
favorite text editor to quickly rename names="""" or whatever. 
Jason said that was a BIG requirement when I 
wrote designer the XML had to be editable - a lot of that stemmed from 
the fact that the first designer couldn't do much more than move stuff

Christian Selig (sledge_) supposed transactioning 
looks simpler that it is to code. Jan agreed, adding 
writing transaction deadlock detection will 
be much more difficult to do code than simple transactional locking 
:) However, there are many other small 
steps to go: f.e. appserver should read out a configuration file 
etc. Christian noted since

problematic as I don't want to store the

saving them in .gsd is not nice, right. 
Jan said that would mean, that you would need a 
seperate file for every gsd - or else have 
a position cache which safes the positions for the last 5 files. 
Christian suggested for the last ""n"" files, 
configurably :) Jan suspected that Christian 
would set it to 9999 or something like that 
:). Christian said i don't know who 
told you rumors that i'd ever do that :). Alternatively, the 
application could try automatic

on foreign key conections tables should be positioned in a way make it easy 
to look at.","2002-07-26","40"
"1280","532","3","Jason Cater (jcater) said he didn't intend 
on the first version of schema designer to be an ERD - /me was thinking 
ala access (grid table) - ERD to me would be a secondary window.
Jan suggested Why not use display modes, i.e. 
you can switch between graphical or table view? 
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked can we 
keep things simple re schema editor in designer - and have REAL design 
sessions for the rest. Jan was not keen on making it look 
too much like Microsoft Access. Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
i am not a huge access fan but in reality
90% of the business population uses access and knows how to use it - 
being able to say if you can use access you 
wont be too lost in GNUe Schema Editor was 
a HUGE factor. 
However, the goal of gnue is not 
access, and there are so many other 
parts of GNUe that need attention it seems silly to put too much effort 
early on into schema stuff - short of making it work. 
Jason said to me, having tables with lines 
connecting them to show foreign keys IS close enough to ERD to call it 
that. He felt that a full graphical canvas for tables 
was overkill for the time being.","2002-07-26","40"
"1281","532","4","Christian said there are two modes: 
editing the tables in grids, and visual display on a canvas - so, 
strategically, either visual display has to be left out or done 
right. Jason agreed - for the time 
being just a table designer. 
Derek said he could do some screen shots 
and such to better facilitate the discussion. Jason felt that 
""done right"" is highly subjective - 
I threw away my ERD packages 3 years ago - because they are 
counter-productive - and once you move beyond a few tables, totally 
useless imho although he isn't 
arguing against such a tool in the future. Christian 
felt that personally, even with large 
databases, a visual designer and, more important, a way to print out 
the visual version :) is very helpful. Jan agreed 
that its quite complicated to work visually 
with more than 20 tables.","2002-07-26","40"
"1282","532","5","Jan posted a 
screenshot of what a visual editor 
could look like. Derek warned wx has 
been well not polite with drag/drop and mouse stuff - so it scares me to 
put too much effort (i do want something like what you are pasting very 
badly) - but im going best bang for buck to start with. As of 
time of writing, im concerned with BASIC
single table creation/modification - i.e. im not against what you are 
proposing but i think its the 'second' step not the first one. 
Initially he envisaged something more like 
this.","2002-07-26","40"
"1283","532","6","
Some days later, Derek pointed to a free 
tool
(nasty ole java) that might be some inspiration for what you all would like 
to do with gnue schema stuff - it is very similar to pgadmin. Jan said 
I think the main goal of having a schema designer 
instead of f.e. pgaccess, is that you design a schema which will work on all 
databases which are supported by GNUe. I.e. it should be very easy to use, 
without providing too much db specific features i.e. if you just use GNUe tools 
for developing and creating your application you can move it from one type of 
database to another just with copying the data from one db to another - 
this is possibly a bit too optimistic, but I would like that :) Both 
Jason and Derek felt this was an absolute requirement. Derek said 
i dont think there is a good 'python' (xplatform) 
tool out there that we could just bolt on support for our schema stuff - 
or i would say lets go that route. I see GNUe as a real framework
in that it shouldnt be a replacement to hardcore db management tools
but certainly developers should be able to use the framework (so they 
dont have to learn something new and/or install more crap).  
I like it from the prospective of it should really help us
a. increase power of python DBSIG
b. increase functionality of our common dbdriver system :)
- maybe someday Zope or such might even consider using it :)","2002-07-26","40"

should define remote calls to other implementations, for getting 
lists of methods, etc - since this should be able to work over 
multiple transports. Jan agreed - 
this would be a kind of introspection 
function which should be added to the API. Andrew said that, 
with some thought, this could be done in most languages - 
for C# i'll probably need to build proxy 
objects using Reflection.Emit, which outputs IL (sort of like 
meta-assembly) - with php - 
generate code & cache it. however 
for GNUe, since we have the beautiful python to use, it's much much 
simpler ;). For php (especially php GroupWare), Andrew said that 
Dan Kuykendall (Seek3r) had hinted that once version 1.0 was 
stabilised, a more structured project will 
be born that makes the phpgwapi more accessible - apps will be composed 
of a backend & a frontend UI - so GNUe will be able to talk to the apps 
quite nicely. Jan said he had talked 
a bit about defining object types with seek3r.","2002-07-29","40"

had to wrap around was fugly. Jan said 
some parts are quite usable, but I can't 
test it, because the triggers are broken. It seemed to be 
using some old-style code, including using triggers to do 
nextRecord(). James said these were now done within the block 
rather than via triggers. The problem with the contact manager 
form was IIRC that data was 
hyper-normalized just like you're taught in class - which doesn't 
work in the real world in most cases IMHO :) and in this case 
had meant having to use a specially-written trigger to check 
data integrity before calling nextRecord().","2002-07-29","40"

it has 
default value already (it is there more than for a month if i'm not

access formFontEncoding (see: GConfig.py). Arturas 
suggested would it be 
good if i add check whether encoding is set - and if not would set 
it to 'iso8859-1'?. Jan suggested a 
much cleaner solution would to add a [gnue] section to the config

i think I started work on this but didn't 
finish. He was wanting a global 
[gnue] section that std gconfig reads first then merges in the specific 
[forms] [reports] etc - so that a person could override specific global

ask jcater personally before I change them - as some of that code hurts my

experience, in the db driver section just asking 
him up front will save you a ton of time - as I didn't know about _toSqlString 
until I talked to him - and it saved a ton of code digging. Now if it's my

support conditions? Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
um it supports conditions right now

conditions were written FOR reports but, 
as the code was in GNUe Common, they could be used in Forms as well. 
Ariel posted the code he was having a problem with, and compared it to 
a working sample of Derek's - there <condition> 
is not inside <conditions> - may be this is the problem, if so the dtd 
of reports is wrong. He confirmed without 
<conditions> works fine.","2002-07-31","41"

used to have local Interbase which was nice for access

"1307","544","2","He felt if you want to do real work and want 
freedom - use SAP-DB. It used to have a proprietary build system, 
but within a week of asking they released 
under the LGPL and provided us with sources. He admitted 
it aint a point and click setup and 
it needs loving from a good DBA. 
if you want to do reasonable work but lower 
administration and still have freedom - i would say use postgres. if you 
want easy admin, lots of penetration, high speed but a slew of other problems 
- use mysql. He felt SAP-DB was in a similar position to Debian as 
a GNU/Linux distribution or python as a languague - 
it has a little higher hump than mysql or 
postgres and you wont find as many folks to aid you bouncing over that hump
- but you will be well rewarded if you do so. However, he noted 
right now, there is about 4 to 5 times the 
traffic on SAP-DB list than there is on all postgres lists combined - 
and most of them are answered by SAP employees. Contrary to FUD they didnt 
drop SAP-DB on the communities lap, they claim to have about 100 folks still 
working on it (i know for certain at least 4 are active in the list). 
He noted 1. I know several hundred to thousands 
of folks use SAP-DB for SAP R/3 in production.  The best mysql example I am 
pointed to is um SLASHDOT. - 2. There are about 100 paid employees pounding 
on SAP-DB.  I dont think postgres or mysql now even have 'real' paid employees 
now, with mysqlAB and greatbridge having so many issues. btw: this is from 
'corporate' prospective not my personal use - i.e. SAP-DB i think will be MUCH 
easier for me to bring into enterprises than mysql. He cut and pasted 
a list of current and planned SAP-DB features from 
the website - basically best i can tell the 
mandate SAP AG has given the SAPDB team is stay compatiable (feature wise) with 
oracle - if someone can point me to postgres/mysql feature sets he would 
do a document setting out the comparisons. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) did not think much of the SAP-DB build script - 
it'd be nice if they had a script in the top directory 
called 'build'. Derek felt they have a 
good right up as 
to WHY they dont use make, noting i think 
jbailey is looking to make it work with make. Once the Debian packages 
were official, he thought that the ability to install SAP-DB using apt-get 
will be the turning point.","2002-07-31","41"

The next day, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) said 
well i couldnt handle the mysql vs postgres 
debate so i posted a story to 
slashdot, 
asking why exactly people arent using SAP-DB? 
It clearly is on par with Oracle, is GPL and frankly has an awesome support 
team in SAP AG.. He had included a link to the GNUe website. He 
admitted the timing was not ideal - as Jason Cater (jcater) pointed 
out, the temporary mirror can't handle 
slashdotting!!!! Derek said if i 
was THINKING i would have put our url as the gnu.org site (i just forget 
we have it at times).","2002-07-31","41"
"1309","544","4","Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) felt SAPD-DB has 
little community support.. which may be more important to an open-source 
product than anything else... Derek said he understood, but 
from a DEVELOPER standpoint they have the 
largest community i have seen - in sense they are only one with a boat 
load of PAID developers. Jason agreed - The 
mailing list has so much traffic I can't keep up. Derek agreed 
that the USER community is pretty much non 
existent - but its chicken vs egg. I think most of folks using SAP-DB 
currently are SAP R/3 customers - so they belong to SAP R/3 communities 
not Free Software communities - not until more free/open projects start 
to use SAP-DB will you see the user community spring up more. There is 
finally a good portal site 
in place to help breed this. James Thompson (jamest) asked 
does our sap/db support work ? er, I mean, 
does it work as well as our postgresql? Derek said 
not entirely - but the SAP-DB is installing 
it and testing it for us and has committed to fix the python SAP-DB 
driver to suit if problems arise - jbailey is workign on debian packages 
as well for SAP-DB.","2002-07-31","41"

Some days later, James noted derek 
got his question posted to slashdot - last week we were on a nice fat 
pipe to the net - this week we're on a small dsl line mirror machine 
while our main server gets shipped across 
the US, as referred to in 
. 
Jason reported actually, my DSL line is holding 
up - as well as monsoon. He commented 
man, what I find really odd about most of the 
slashdot posts re SAP-DB are they basically ask ""but why would you want 
something that big for web apps?"" - who the fsck said anything about web 
apps? Stuart Bain (stbain) said I've 
used PostgreSQL for web apps in the past and it hauls butt once you have 
the connection open - performance difference between it and MySQL was 
negligble. Derek noted several comments that basically implied 
if sap-db is so good and free why are 
people paying top dollar for oracle? - 
of course my gut reaction is ""so why do 
you run linux again?"" I mean most fortune 500 wont touch it and they 
would rather pay for windows, but this did not make Microsoft 
Windows ""better.""","2002-07-31","41"
"1311","544","6","Stuart pointed out that the SAP-DB website was clear that 
If you use SAP DB as a database system for SAP 
solutions, a maintenance contract is required, which meant that 
using SAP-DB with SAP's own ERP systems was not free of charge anyway.
Derek clarified that this was not violation 
of GPL BECAUSE sap owns the copy right - just like mozilla and open office 
are owned by parent companies that do DUAL LICENSE so SAP can choose to 
release SAP-DB under the GPL and yet offer other licensing to it as 
well. Stuart asked so I can release my 
code as GPL and w/ a stipulation that in order to use it, you have to pay 
me a support contract? Derek said no - 
you could however release your code and say version A is available under 
the GPL - version B is available under the STBAIN license - if you want to u
se stu's crazy app it only works with version B. He felt the 
confusion was because they are trying to be 
HONEST i.e. they arent restricting a GPL app - they are just putting notice 
on the GPL one that hey dont download this and expect to use it with SAP/R3 
w/o paying maintenance. Stuart suggested they 
should tie the contract to the SAP product, not the database. Derek 
agreed - its not a stipulation i think in the 
GPL license of SAP-DB but probably clauses in SAP R/3 that do the 
'enforcing' of this.","2002-07-31","41"

sap a list of 'gripes' from slashdot postings - they posted a great

"1313","544","8","
The next day, Derek said he had been talking to SAP-DB about 
the oracle 7 compatiablity mode and 
some features in the python driver? That it sounded like a cheap 
way to do some query compatiablity testing. Stuart Bain 
(stbain) asked sapdb really that 
good? Peter Sullivan (psu) said 
it's all about position in the db food 
chain - you start at the bottom w/ your M$ Access, then move up to 
MySQL, then to postgreSQL. But after that, next step up is the 
industrial-strength databases - where Oracle is the 800-pound 
gorilla but SAP-DB has aspirations to be the Pepsi. 
Also, also it is always significant 
when a big co puts something that was non-free under GPL - 
""more joy in heaven over one sinner repented"" etc. 
James suggested that, if Oracle was a gorilla, then 
access = slime mold ; mysql = dolphin?
; postgres = elephant ; GNUE = the goat that wants to jiggy with 
all of 'um.","2002-07-31","41"
"1314","544","9","Stuart asked about python/perl drivers 
for SAP-DB. Peter suggested python 
drivers I think are high-profile with the SAP-DB developers now - 
'cause there's this weird GPL enterprise project out there keeps 
asking about them ;-) For PHP, Stuart confirmed
From version 4.0.3, PHP 4 accesses SAP DB 
via PHP's Unified ODBC and the SAP DB ODBC-driver. Similar to Perl, 
this can be performed using a driver manager. so you have to load unix 
odbc.","2002-07-31","41"
"1315","544","10","Earlier, Stuart asked about Microsoft MSSQL. Derek said that, as 
a database, he would rate it above MySQL and 
probably even postgres - BUT its a single 
platform and has bad license so i rule it out for anything. 
It was definantly not a mickey mouse 
database, but it ties your rump to mickey 
soft and thats just bad news. By contrast, 
SAP-DB is comparable to Oracle and in some 
ways looks like it might be better than DB2 - and is GPL. It has an Oracle 
7 compatiablity mode to try to get people off oracle, but its not always 
a 'clean' switch. He confirmed that 
PHP support is till through ODBC - 
i think its just more official and you can compile --with-sapdb 
or such and it does the odbc stuff for you or something. 
He love that all python interfaces are native 
(and might i add BEST supported) - in fact it is only binding that has 
full api to things outside querying and such - like the database manager 
and the replication manager.","2002-07-31","41"
"1316","545","1","It was asked what was in the bayonne downloads directory on the website, 
and if it was needed for the rest of GNUe. 
James said this was just a mirror of the offical 
bayonne sources.
Bayonne at its simplest could be used to program voice-mail systems, 
but it's more powerfull than just that - 
you can have systems phone home, interface w/ voice mail systems, create 
interactive applications and so on. eventually 
we want our forms client to work w/ it so that users can input data via a phone 
interface.","2002-08-01","41"
"1317","545","2","James explained that most GNUe tools can stand 
alone - so if you want to use just forms or just reports then are you free to 
do so - however all the gnue tools, except bayonne and dcl, will require GNUe 
Common as it's our core library As well as python, 
you only need db drivers for dbs you use - 
you will need the wxpython installed if you want to use forms as it's the only 
UI driver currently working. He later explained 
the UI system is designed to take other 
user interface drivers but needs cleaned up and 
refined. He admitted wx 
is love/hate for us - love it as it gives us win32, *nix, Mac OS/X gui in one 
package - hate it as it's quirky as hell.","2002-08-01","41"

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) said but

some code and corrected it to take 
format masks from gnue.conf. Jason explained that the code 
Arturas had corrected had been just a place 
holder until we could get DateMasks working - but for the time being, moving 
to gnue.conf will work I suppose. He would prefer the config 
option to be called something other than formatMask, 
because we may want a default number mask too - 
so formatMask=  wouldn't look right when we added the number one

- I just needed a way to hook them into forms. That was the intention of 
GFDisplayHandler -- to provide hooks for FormatMasks. James suggested

what IT is doing :) as the boss 
can be autonotified as statuses change and such - and cutesy little 
management reports can be done for staff meetings.

problem it probably doesnt matter, cause your peon butt will probably fix 
it before you even consider opening DCL to give it a priority.

emergency type problems that get submitted? e.g. send a short message to

eventually acclite/NOLA would run off GNUe Application Server

'goals'. There was no specific acclite mailing list, as 
we really dont want a fork at this point
and were still hopeful that NOLA's owners would adopt the changes - 
if we do a list and such it looks like we are 
brute forking it. The only reason they had even set up a separate CVS 
was more than one person was doing them so we 
needed it. He felt quite frankly its likely 
it will be fork as they may choose to not accept it - though they seemed 
interested so we arent ruling it out. He confirmed that NOLA (and 
hence acclite) was US based so follows US 
accounting practices.","2002-08-11","42"

""streamlinedness"" at the moment - and the completeness :).

it from being Free?  basically would Sun have to totally change 
its behavior or its licensing or both or what? 
Christian said i think that even 
if j2ee was free, there would still be a reason to develop gnue. 
(hint: java) - nothing Free in FSF sense in Java.

real popular in GNUe land as a 
language from a technical point of view.","2002-08-13","42"

Daniel suggested just non-free 
Java - i.e., things that there is no free equivalent -
although to be fair, GNUe developers were not keen on Java 
as a language even if the freedom issues could be resolved. 
However, there's no free j2ee

that gnue's application framework is not 
appropriately generalizable toward groupware?
or is it that the gnue team isn't interested 
in doing so? what if outsiders were to be made interested? are the 
models that drastically different between a groupware and a 
transactional enterprise framework? 
He explained the existing hotbed of groupware 
that's got all the development happening, is in the LAMP space 
(using Linux, Apache, mySQL and PHP) - and 
there's nothing wrong with all that but it's just that the LAMP space 
tends to be infested with junior, ""not invented here"" programming demo 
style coders - so they need an app building 
framework which is as easy as gnue - gnue is easy at building specific 
kinds of apps - and if it was more fully web enabled (liek with a php or 
sashxb style presentation driver) and if it had groupware components, then 
someone could use it as a groupware RAD - then we add the ancillary 
components such as device drivers, palm sync, and external bridges to WAP 
or other messaging and formatting, and b3wm - no more 
phpgropuware.","2002-08-15","43"
"1353","566","2","Later, he asked does gnue have any degree of 
collaborative infrastructure?  or is it just a concurrently-usable 
multiple-individual transaction oriented infrastructure? 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said that was what GNUe Common was 
for - it has the db absatraction, the rpc 
abstraction, and other code fr writing apps (both server and 
client) such as the debug system, 
the xml parser, trigger stuff, the connections 
code for linking a form up to a db, the commn object model, format masks, 
lots of *stuff* - appserver uses mainly the db and rpc *stuff*.","2002-08-15","43"
"1354","566","3","
Two days later, towards the end of a all night long, off-topic, 
discussion, Dan said that the GNUe team 
have to not downplay web services :>. 
Daniel said we don't - 
the have abstraction layer fr most web service protocols - xmlrcp, soap, 
etc. and appserver should talk 
to anything by exposing ""web services"". Dan accepted 
that you often want super fast data entry in 
a local binary app but you should have 
web access later. Daniel mentioned the php Forms client written 
by Jan Ischebeck. Dan asked what about 
generalizing GNUe as a general web app 
platform or collaborative platform/ - he said that Michael Dean 
(mdean) had been waving around about that long ago - 
but when i talked with derek after lwce, he said that gnue has a 
fundmanetally different model (transactoinal oriented or whatever) - 
and is not optimized for that directly, fwiw. He did not see 
any real difference, however. Daniel said 
you ""submit"" the form - 
you ""commit"" a transaction - same frelling thing ;).","2002-08-15","43"
"1355","566","4","Dan asked is there any reason why we can't make 
a *generalized* RAD out of gnue instead of just for database oriented 
forms? - i mean you have a drag-n-drop UI for forms and db stuff...  why 
can't those widgets be, say, user-oriented or task-oriented or 
schedule-oriented? He realised that GNUe Designer was a type of 
RAD tool, but only for a specific type of app as 
opposed to, say, designing a calendar. Daniel said that 
the appserver will provide objects eventually
- that is very generic - and you don't have to be a db guru then - just 
an object lackey. GNUe Application Server 
still needs to use 
a db to store its objects, but I think 
objects give you the generic thing that you desire.","2002-08-15","43"
"1356","566","5","Dan asked are there any alternative RADs which already 
exist (like zope or whatever) which are compatible with gnue so we could get 
started building groupware on your current gnue shizzit?  Daniel knew of 
Zope, but had never used it - we have so much code and 
time invested in our framework - I dunno who has the time to adapt to an 
existing one - or if it would ever make sense to throw away our stuff rather 
than picking some existing appserver. Dan said that 
phpgroupware is state of the art as far as free groupware, 
but it's not state of the art in terms of app services - it 
would suck a lot less if groupware developers were 
magically granted a kick ass framework to start with Daniel said 
that there had been discussions with the phpGW team - they  
do not wish to invest time into 
gnue integration - this had been one of the reasons that 
Michael Dean had affiliated DCL with GNUE rather than phpGW. 
Dan Bethe said that Dan Kuykendall (seek3r) has slightly 
reopened somewhat to the idea of moving toward gnue's direction, one way or 
another - but still! that's a bit of a leap.","2002-08-15","43"
"1357","566","6","He felt that free groupware needed major app 
frameworks that were FSF-compatible, and hence not based on Java - 
the only FSF-compatible alternative to the excellent 
enterprise quality stuff that's being done in java today, is in LAMP - 
which is strong but is not ubiquitous enough - for example it's 
web-only, which could prove unsuitable for tasks 
like mass data entry. GNUe could provide 
an alternative, fully free, application framework for groupware 
development. He asked if stuff like j2ee be made to sit 
atop gnue?  or only interoperate via message passing like soap/xmlrpc?
Daniel said I think all our components/servers 
will be web enabled and export remote interfaces.","2002-08-15","43"

GNUe compares to Compiere. Peter Sullivan (psu) 
said that the big issue for people here 
is that Compiere, although free (as in freedom) itself
has non-free dependancies such as Java and (the biggie) Oracle DB 
s/w i.e. unless you have sold your soul to Oracle for a database, 
it's just  a kool but inert lump of code - GNUe is designed to have 
no non-free depends at all i.e. you can use GNUe w/Oracle - but you 
can also use with MySQL, Freebird, postgresql, SAB-DB etc. 
Matt noted that they're making progress on 
PG support though.. Peter said at 
moment, we have tools (very good tools) for building apps - especially 
in 2 tier mode (i.e. forms talks direct to database) - but are a bit 
short on apps themselves as frankly we really want our appserver working 
i.e. would like our official apps to be 3-tier from start.","2002-08-19","43"

PeopleSoft and the likes.","2002-08-19","43"

forms can read forms definitions from an

once we have appserver working well
(there's already a proof of concept version) then the biz logic sits 
there. He explained geas == old app

"1376","577","1","Adam Hull (fixe) asked about GNUe Application Server what 
language it is in, why gnue decided to write their own, what were other app 
servers lacking? how far along is the project? Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
noted that its in python - 
its in early alpha stage, i.e. quite functional but 
lacking some important feature like transactions etc. Adam said he was 
looking at application servers for phpGroupware (phpGW) as he was concerned that 
phpGW will not scale to enterprise level but 
idealy it would be nice to have phpgw as a front end for 
an enterprise app server. He asked can python 
scale? Jan thought that python was at least as scalable as Java, which 
was often used for application servers. He noted that Dan Kuykendall (seek3r) 
had talked about writing a PHP equivalence to the RPC 
abstraction in gnue-common - he explained 
Appserver is using gnue-common, which means access to 
almost all SQL92 compatible databases, and a modular RPC system. It was 
felt that re-writing GNUe Common in PHP was unecessary, as PHP clients (such as 
the GNUe phpForms client that Jan had already written) could just use the 
existing GNUe Common via RPC (remote procedure calls). The main reason 
for GNUe writing its own Application Server was the need to use completely free 
software - others, like jboss, were GPL (GNU Public License) in themselves, but 
had non-free dependencies like Java. Also, on functionality, GNUe wanted an 
Application Server that had RPC abstraction, Object to Relational mapping engines 
and a Business Rule Language abstraction, so that business rules could be written 
in any computer language there was a plug-in for, not just python. These last two 
points were longer term goals, but were still important.","2002-08-25","44"

the main cause - the GTK patch went

make CVS access more widespread or switch to

access - but with the implication that they have to have the time to

outstanding, what's been submitted, who has cvs and who doesn't and I'm

suggested that all of papo's patches should be rolled together and applied 
blind if people did not have time to review them. Peter felt 
IMHO, a patch from papo is almost as safe as

themselves on a daily basis - and they hang 
out here and talk to us, so know why we do some things the way we do

I've seen ""Why not C/C++/java loads of 
times, but never lisp but given 
it's reputation as an AI lang I guess it could be a good lang for 
writing business rules in. He said that 
The intent is that some day AppServer 
should support multiple langs for triggers/business logic etc - 
These will be abstracted in the same way as the database and RPC 
via GNUe Common. Hence, as long as someone can write a ""wrapper"" for 
LISP to speak to the python code base of AppServer then yes, we will 
support LISP or any other languague. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) said the trigger system 
will support multiple language and appserver will use it just as forms 
does now, iirc. Karlis said that 
for triggers it should be easy, object 
tree has to be represented somehow. Daniel said 
it is represented in xml as a GObject
in common. Karlis said that this was fine, 
but to have ""full"" control in other 
lang, not just function set(path, value), get(path) - all tree has 
to be made ""native"" imho.","2002-08-30","45"
"1386","583","2","Peter said that Application Server was the key to the GNUe 
project as of time of writing, as we 
have held off doing packages (Financials, HR, etc) until we have a 
reasonable appserver to base them on. There's no reason per se why 
we couldn't write a Finance package in Forms in 2-tier (forms talks 
to d/b) - but that's *so* 20th century... The fashion these days is 
n-tier (forms to appserver to db). There had been an 
initial, proof-of-concept, release of the new Application Server in 
July. He explained a simple example of 
biz logic would be that the lines on an invoice must add to the 
invoice header total. In 2-tier, you'd have an on-submit trigger to 
check this & throw a ""fix it bozo"" msg to user if wrong. In 
n-tier, this checking sits in appserver as a very simple biz rule.
Obviously, biz rules can be much more complex than this - and may 
involve workflow-style processes e.g. balanced invoice goes to Fred 
for approval - but that's the basic idea AFAIK. Karlis 
deduced aha, and this way gnue 
application will consist of related form and report definitions and 
business logic written for appserver.","2002-08-30","45"
"1387","583","3","Derek Neighbors (derek) said GNUe was not written in LISP as 
LISP is NOT a business programmers 
language END of STORY. He added 
btw: we DO support lisp - well scheme - 
our appserver/forms have a pl  ugable business rules engine 
architecture where by anyone wishing to fashion a plugin engine for 
their language can. The current 
appserver only supports python - but it is in the specification to 
have exposed api where as you can use any language you like - even 
Visual Basic or such. This had been discussed in detail with 
Richard Stallman (rms). Also, python was better for cross-platform 
support than LISP - python + wxwindows 
gave us win32, *nix, mac out of box. However, this had caused 
the FSF some problems because there was 
brief time that python had issues with licensing, but this 
had been resolved with Guido van Rossum (guido), the author of 
python. Some initial prototyping work on Forms, and the original 
version of GNUe Application Server (GNUe) had been written in C, 
and at one point we were going to try 
scheme/lisp but the issues at that stage were
a. horrid documentation and 
b. no good toolkit 
support for doing xplatform UI (even weak single platform 
support). However, this had probably changed in the 4 years 
since GNUe had started. Karlis asked was 
rms for lisp or against python? Derek said 
a little of both. Mostly for lisp i think. 
It was odd as we were the ones originally concerned with python once it 
was in licensing limbo - so we approached rms to talk with guido. It was 
then sometime later that he came back and asked why not lisp (after python 
was fixed) - or at least thats how i seem to remember it.","2002-08-30","45"

forms talks to appserver via a driver which 
makes rpc calls to the Application Server -

handle introspection so you can't use designer

Jason Cater (jcater) said it converts the xml attributes, 
which are always stored as strings, to the appropriate datatypes -  
a string, or a float, or whatever is needed.
This meant that the attribute name is expected to be 
A-Za-z_- or such - i.e., representable in the python namespace. He

GSObject for? I know it is like the parent of the heirarchy bt why did you write 
it? Jason said it's there in case I need to add 
functionality in the future - with forms and reports, we didn't have that common 
class - but needed it later on and regretted having to change all the code :)
Just consider it planning ahead, although it is useless now. He also

The next day, Daniel asked what was 
that option to Attributes dict in the parser dict for allwing the top 
level element to be a child of some other element sometimes? ;)
Jason said um, actually I think I told you wrong
- will the element only be a top-level element OR an element of a specific 
tag? i.e., it's not like <b> in html where it can be a child of almost 
anything? if that's the case, then I think the logical thing to do is set 
ParentTags: (None,'theOtherTag'). Daniel confirmed it would be a
nested tag. Jason suggested 
you might want to look at common/src/GConditions.py
and see how I handle nested ""ands"", ""ors"" etc. Daniel said that 
the XML he was trying to parse had a 
<spec> can contain <definition> which can contain a 
<module< which can contain a <spec>....nested. 
Jason said so I think you want to set spec's 
ParentTag to (None, 'module'). Daniel explained 
spec just allows for no containing module
- so things are in the ""default"" module. Jason agreed - 
that at least looks logical.","2002-09-01","45"

The next day, Daniel asked is there any 
documentation the xmlElements parser dict? Jason replied 
the code. Daniel said he was starting 
a parser for the ODL xml format. 
He asked why GNUe did not use xml.dom? - I 
think that lives in pyxml and/or xml.minidom. Jason said 
many reasons, including 
dom requires you to load the entire thing into 
memory before using - which could become a biggie for really big 
projects. He was more an event-driven 
guy - not a tree-driven one. Daniel asked 
aren't you building your own tree?. 
Jason agreed, but we do more than that. 
It also provided default values, initialization,
conversion from old, deprecated formats to current format, importing - 
oh, and all Designer needs is that dictionary to be able to support the 
basics of a product - that was the biggie as I don't want to have to code 
a product twice - once for the actual runtime and once for the designer 
module. That's why I cringe everytime I hear ""why not use DTD instead of 
the GFParser.py dictionary?"" - um, because our dictionary is doing more 
than parsing XML :) Daniel said he did not 
want to make life harde fr designer - 
but I figure appserver will have an metaobject api (operations to add 
classes, methods to existing classes, etc.) and/or you can modify the xml 
files directly. Jason was cornfused - 
as I didn't think we were starting out w/ODL. Daniel said that 
the old .gcd (GNUe Class Definition) files were basically 
IDL + some stuff wanting to be ODL - 
ODL == IDL + classes, attributes, relationships, and 
collections.","2002-09-01","45"
"1399","588","5","Later, Daniel noted that IDL was used 
in making corba interfaces to the previous version of 
GNUe Application Server (GEAS) - imho, 
corba was the old geas's problem and the fact it was 
writtin in C did not help with intergration with existing code. 
Given that DOM is just an API, 
I have no reason to use DOM - would require 
parsing a tree twice - waste of time. Nick Rusnov (nickr) said 
he liked DOM better than SAX. 
Daniel said yes, but the way the gnue tools 
works is you don't have to create a DOM tree representing xml and then 
create a tree of objects that access the other code like the rpc stuff, 
the db layer, etc. - thus we can also use the SAX parser to create 
metaobjects straight from the xml for the appserver. 
Nick suggested you could use DOM internally 
for the objects :) Daniel said we 
create a tree of GObjs directly so they are like an internal DOM. 
Nick agreed that sax is good if your object 
model isn't much like the XML tree, or you don't want to deal with the 
overhead in your model, but as Daniel pointed out 
ours is exactly like an xml tree - 
at least from what I am told. Nick said 
well why not use dom then - serialization 
and loading is trivial then?","2002-09-01","45"

Bajusz agreed - yes, it is for ""cosmetics"" 
formatting - but reports needs this too. Jason asked 
so are you thinking we take the FO elements 
that we need and add them to our spec - or just use all of FO as it 
sits? Bajusz was not sure - maybe 
it's too complex for a business report. Jason was also 
torn - the 
GNUe Reports engine could output FO markups right now - currently, we 
have the SimpleTabulation style we could easily add a FormattingObjects

post of Jason's which said that the Reports Engine should allow for
a PDF (or HTML or TeX) formatting engine (instead 
of an external XSLT script) for reports of type GNUe:Reports:Standard that 
the engine could load. However, Bajusz noted that this needed

alook and try to port it to forms..","2002-09-08","46"

gnue-reports myreports begindate=09/02/02 enddate=09/03/02 - 
2) the conditions can just appear in the output of reports
i.e., gnue-reports myreports custom_title=""My Sales Report"" - 
I would foresee forms using it similarly - i.e., it could use 
them in datasources to limit a query or it could be values 
that trigger code could access. Datasources inherently support 
parameters - but only reports currently passes them. It should 
be trivial to get forms to - it just hasn't happened 
yet.","2002-09-08","46"

will take over from there. Marcos agreed -

into self.PARAMETERS or the like an then they're copied all over 
the code till they become GRParameters....","2002-09-08","46"

parameters for Forms was because we're 
thinking about a kind of 'app' that would integrate a lot of forms

also handle app config and, more specifically, users and roles. 
It was suggested that it might be better to discuss this, as 
Navigator was supposed to support role-based access control at 
some point, and tools to manage things like connections.conf had 
also been discussed previously. Peter Sullivan (psu) suggested 
Actually, if connections.conf was XML,

using forms itself to edit its own config 
files? Jason said he had thought 
about that before - /me even considered making IMAP and POP3 
dbdrivers for gnue-common - but then the more I thought about it
the more I thought that might be hellacious to maintain for the 
little benefit derived. Jan asked whether 
you think that writing a seperate app, 
or config dialog to do this is easier? Jason said 
I think a popup dialog in Designer to do 
this may be best - I'm honestly not sure - I'm torn in several 
directions. ","2002-09-08","46"

params to datasources? Jason said it was already in

well - search for 'cparam' in 
GRParser.","2002-09-08","46"

do you want to use parameters in Forms?

but we already have the capability w/reports - 
and there's time in the past I've needed them. 
Marcos said we were thinking of calling forms 
with data already there. Jason said I've 
needed to do that as well - where you can change the dataset used just by 
passing a parameter.","2002-09-08","46"
"1440","608","8","Jan asked whether the default 
values for a parameter are defined in the .gfd (GNUe Forms 
Definition) file - this did not seem to be right, as 
<cparam> just take a 
""name"" and no ""value"" attribute. Jason said 
in reports, I had a separate <parameter> 
tag that defined valid parameters and any default values. 
He had not considered default values 
w/forms - the cparam tag was for something else. Jan
suggested why not use the same tag in forms 
as in reports, although he noted that 
the <parameter> tag in report has quite a few attributs.
- I don't know if we could use/need/implement all of them ( 'name' 
'required' 'limited' 'default' 'description' 'source' 'type' ). 
Jason felt we at least need 'type' and 
'default'.","2002-09-08","46"
"1441","608","9","Jan asked what the 'limited' and 'source' options were for. 
Jason said that is primarily for 
reports, explaining the plan 
was to have a gnue-reports client that would prompt for the 
parameters - if they weren't specified on the command line - 
and source= could point to a datasource that would give valid values
and limited= would specify the valid values (neither of those 2 
options are implemented) as of time of writing. 
Jan thought we still could use ""source"" 
in forms as paramters could be 
f.e. provided by a database. He felt that 
using parameter tags with source attributs 
could be a SQL less solution replacing ""simpleQuery"" commands in 
triggers. Jason felt imho that's 
making parameters too complex - i.e., then you have a datasource
not a parameter. Jan accepted this, but felt that 
the main usage for parameters in forms is 
to send information from a main form to a popup subform, 
which Jason agreed with. Jan felt IMHO 
its just would be easier to share the parameter definition 
with reports than create a new one. Jason said 
it should be rolled into GClientApp - 
but for the time being I'm going to leave them as they 
are.","2002-09-08","46"

only way to pass parameters to Forms

there).","2002-09-08","46"
"1443","609","1","Ariel Calò (ariel_) was reviewing 
the code in _featuretest and wondered why
the field type in geas_meta_object is 
varchar rather than a look-up to another table of allowed values
for Object types. This would save space, mean that 
only 'known' types can be inserted 
and that specific info 
on the type can be stored in other fields of geas_meta_type, for 
example if type is 'function' the language or wathsoever. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said The idea 
was to only use one table at the beginning, and split it up into 
multiple tables later. Ariel said that, as of time of 
writing, geas_meta_object is filled 'by 
hand' - i guess tomorrow a parser will do the job, but which 
language will be used? gsd, idl, odl, godl or what?
Jan said there will be many parsers which 
can fill the internal structures. It was suggested that the 
intial version of appserver should not focus on objects until the 
basics were done. Jan said since I 'm not 
100% conviced that odl/odmg 3.0 ... is the best choice for internal 
structures etc. I would prefer a own format first. I think using 
.gsd as a start would be ok. we can later add all that ODMG features 
to appserver and to the godl / odl parsers. Ariel said 
separation of code and definitions is not a 
bad thing, it improves reusability - you can improve the code for a 
single method without reloading/recompiling the whole thing. 
Jan felt I don't think, that putting code 
and definition together is a must, but it makes things much easier.
btw. appserver could provide a ""load new code into function X"" method, 
which solves that problem. I just want to program like in f.e. python 
and not in the way like C, where I always have to change two file 
(.h, .c) if I modify the interfaces.","2002-09-08","46"

started writing a parser for it, but there seems to be a heaps of 
reasons not to use 'gcd', I just don't remeber :) Ariel suggested 
can i improve gcdparser.py just to 
convert all the existing .gcd (GNUe Class Defintion) definitions 
from the draft GNUe package proposals into the .gsd (GNUe Schema 
Definition) format. Jan said that would be 
great :). Ariel said this would probably be a one-off conversion - 
what we need is only the output, i.e the 
gsd's. Jan felt it would be much 
easier to use geas to build up its db structure and then use designer 
to create a gsd out of it, but Ariel was 
not sure it will work, because 'type' in gcd 
doesn't create classes but just reusable definitions.","2002-09-08","46"

that or just not track accounting stuff, which is what we currently

"1450","611","2","Later, Nicholas Lee (esands) said he had tried 
the cvs version of gnucash and the new business 
conponents.  Now I'm fiddling around with acclite to see what thats 
like. He felt that the business part 
of gnucash is functional - It has promising and is usable. However, if 
you've used gnucash before you'll know when I says its very manual, 
reflecting the fact that the main developer had (not unreasonably) 
designed it so far mostly for his own use. 
Derek said it really needed to be developed to do 
reads/writes to SQL database - 
i.e. flatfiles are just not suitable for business (imho). 
Nicholas said I figure its current target is 
home size businesses. Derek agreed - 
to me its a quickbooks replacement (or sounds 
like) - which there is a market for, but not market persay that gnue is 
going after. ","2002-09-08","46"
"1451","611","3","Later, Nicholas  said its probably worth 
changing the acclite footer to point at the gnue web site instead of the 
nola site.  Its not polite otherwise. Derek said 
i figured not giving them attribution was 
worse. fwiw: the idea is not to have a fork - just to finish our 
regutting and give back to noguska - at which point if they dont like 
we fork. Nicholas said Sure, but for 
the purposes of bug reports acclite is not their problem.  Since its not 
their development. Derek agreed, though 
it was never meant as public consumption - short of gnue folks helping us 
review our changes :) it kind of grew into more than that, because we were 
slow getting changes back to nola.","2002-09-08","46"
"1452","611","4","
Some days later, Nicholas asked is there a 
reason why you guys decided to base acclite on this instead of 
sql-ledger? Jason Cater (jcater) said that 
sql-ledger looks really bad under the 
hood. It was noted that sql-ledger was written in 
uncommented perl. Nicholas felt that nola 
has some issues as well.  Like at the moment it doesnt seem to have a 
sales tax acculation flag for vendor invoices.  Might have missed it 
though. Jason agreed there were issues - 
that's why we branched it :) - 
but the underlying structure looked by far more advanced than most of 
the free accounting packages we looked at.","2002-09-08","46"
"1453","611","5","Later, Jason asked is gnucash actually 
usable? Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
it's missing some small business features
- they are adding that - I think it may be in cvs. Jason 
said there's no way I'd use gnu-cash for small 
business - it just ain't right. Daniel said 
well of course not - it's ""personal"" finance
and as derek mentioned before - a different market ;)
Nicholas said gnucash is usable.  And their 
are some small business features in the cvs; they are workable, but 
require some more polish.  I think it does have scheduled now in the 
cvs as well - I'd check but my machine with the gnucash cvs deb is 
still broken.","2002-09-08","46"
"1454","611","6","Nicholas asked is it possible to get 
read access to the acclite cvs?  Would make hacking on it a little 
easier. Jason said unfortunately 
we don't have anonymous cvs for acclite - I can set up ssh-based 
access. Nicholas said That would 
be better than downloading the 2Mb *-09-10.. and discovering it was 
the same as 09-08.. He asked what's 
the goal with acclite at the moment?  What sort of work needs 
doing? is it tidying up postgres issues, like that ''/'0' defaults 
patchs I forwarded though or working on the gnue side of things? 
Jason said I think there are still a few oddities 
left over from our conversion from mysql to postgresql - but the biggest 
goal is to write GNUe Forms screens for the various PHP screens. Probably 
the first goal is little stuff like you posted - that are showstoppers when 
testing.","2002-09-08","46"
"1455","611","7","Nicholas asked about coding style. He hates 
the (non) ident in nola's php files. Crazy mad-driving screen fulls of 
characters.... Derek agreed - his php coding/indentation style 
was heavily influenced by python, though im 
not a nazi - i.e. if its code im not complaining - but this is one reason 
i liked python so much - is it elminates this debate entirely

"1456","612","1","Further to
, 
Nicholas Lee (esands) agreed that Definitely gnue 
and gnucash target different markets.  The big different though between the 
two products is that gnucash is stable having reached MILESTONE 1. 
Gnue is still work in progress. Useful no doubt, but still needing 
further work. Derek Neigfhbors (derek) said 
we have really hit past our milestone one - 
as our first milestones were for the framework not the applications - 
and soon now, we will enter first phase of application development. 
Expect working goodies within the month - and kick butt goodies within 6 
months. He had sold GNUe to a few 
customers last month alone - there is this fixation that 'shrinkwrap' means 
good and complete which he felt was often unwarrented - 
oh well different markets i suppose.","2002-09-08","46"
"1457","612","2","Nicholas said Sure, but you are a core developer. 
Consider the part-developer who spends a lot of time doing business stuff (ie. 
me ;). I'm ready to do some work (hell I've compiled gnucash cvs to for myself) 
but I don't have a lot of time to spend trying to get things going. Or at least 
that's been my experience so far with gnue. Of course since its a FS/OSS type 
project I've missed much in the last three months. Things are probably different 
again. Derek said on a BLANK debian 
install gnue takes no longer than say 20 minutes to install (including postgres) 
- on redhat/mandrake then yes its hell, but i cant help crappy packaging

"1458","612","3","Nicholas felt that the lack of 
documentation make it tricky to use.  Although I haven't checked the document 
in the last couple months. Derek agreed that the 
yes docs are not quite there - problem is its a 
framework not an application - so making docs is difficult - as there is a 
certain amount of given one needs to know - until we get a real users 
manual. But docs for a framework (that 
covers all users) is a HUGE task - and we dont want our developers doing it - 
and we havent had volunteers :) He accepted that 
we have personal needs for gnue - and so we are 
concentrating on the tools and our needs - we would love someone to help with 
docs. Nicholas agreed itches to scratch 
are the reason projects like this exist.  Wouldn't be fun for you to do it 
otherwise.","2002-09-08","46"
"1459","612","4","He suggested You guys probably need something 
like a wiki/fom.  Make document in the first instance a communitity 
task Derek felt that wiki's are good 
for informal documentation and throwing ideas around - but i dont think they 
shoudl be a documentation substitution. Hans Kugler (LuftHans) felt 
that docs with room for comments on the end are 
better, they're semi-wiki. Nicholas felt I 
think though at the moment you don't really have any formal document. 
Something that's easy keep up to date is more important than something that 
is 'formal'. Derek said that we like to 
deal with thing slike we do in business world i.e. get up and go to someones 
desk - in our world the equivalent is IRC. Nicholas said 
Business process is important to document. 
Otherwise if you have outsides/newbies entering a business unit without 
knowledge of how tasks are processed its harder to bring them up to speed 
without effective resources. Derek said you 
misunderstood me - i didnt say business process was unimportant to document. 
At work we have a professional technical writer that comes to our meetings 
and translates our development process - i dont have that here ;)
He noted that Peter Sullivan (psu) does this to a 
degree with his kernel cousins and i adore him dearly for it.

an explanation
on the FSF web site. It was explained that the paperwork did not 
normally take long - minor patches

I'm now a co-maintainer for DEbian 
glibc. This was because of his work for GNU/Hurd, 
which depended heavily on glibc. Even so, Nick Rusnov (nickr) 
felt thats like 'oh by the way I'm 
now the president of ex-soviet republic of georgia'. 
Jeff said an important pre-requisite of him doing 
GNUe debs was to try getting gnue to 
work one day. Y'know that I've still *never* gotten it installed, 
right? =) It was suggested that, if they had help for 
the first run of Debian packages, the GNUe team could probably 
do most of the maintenance work themselves afterwards, as they 
were mainly Debian GNU/Linux users anyway. Nick, referring to 
his efforts in

said Well if dist-utils wheren't so 
cockeyed they'd be done by now Jeff agreed - 
The limited python hacking I've done

for a mass conversion from distutils to the autotools finally?

were keen on autotools either. James Thompson (jamest) felt 
that dist utils? it sucks. It just 
sucked less that autoconf for python. Jeff asked 
What is it that you needed out of autotools 
that it failed at?  Last time we spoke (like 18 months ago) you 
hadn't tried it at all. James said that
gnue used autoconf before distutils
from the start - we rapidly switched to distutils at that time

"1478","622","5","Phil said he was updating the ""Introduction for 
Developers Docs"" - Having most trouble with 
the ""Architecture"" part - Application and ICL both seem to be GNUe Forms. 
Peter said well, there are (both in theory and 
practice), different versions of GNUe Forms i.e. GNUe Forms as we know it 
(wxpython) is just ""an"" implementation of GNUe Forms, not ""the"". 
As well as this, we have a (broken) curses 
(text-only) Forms client which I believe Gontran was looking at fixing and 
the phpForms client that Jan did some work on before getting lured into working 
on Appserver. In addition to these, most 
other popular and obscure langs and UIs had been proposed at some time.
In effect, a Forms client is anything that can 
parse .gfd (GNUe Forms Definition) files and produce an interface of some sort 
for the end-user to interact with. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) felt that 
this section of the documentation needed a 90% 
rewrite - there should be 1) Backend (RDBMS, 
etc) provided by postgres,sapdb... accessed by GEDI (GNUe Enterprise 
Data Integrator) 2) middleware (optional) provided 
by appserver - 3) client/thin client provided by forms. It would 
also be important to say something about 
gnue-common in there. I.e. that gnue-common provides the connection between 
the different levels, i.e it provides GEDI/database abstraction (used by 
appserver(3-tier) /forms (2-tier)) and GNURPC i.e. RPC-abstraction (connection 
between appserver and forms, or reports and reports server). 
He noted that applications 
code/buisness rules can be moved  into 1+3 (i.e. two-tier) or in 2 
(three-tier). Phil asked how you would store business rules in the

stored procedures or triggers in the database :) However,

gsd isn't meant to describe business objects 
just schema. Ariel asked, if the old GNUe Class Definition (.gcd) format 
used by the previous incarnation of GNUe Application Server (GEAS) 
is dead, long life to what? Jason said 
good question - we haven't gotten that far. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said that gsd is XML and 
gsd can be a starting point for more. f.e. we can first use it to describe 
and build tables which are provided by appserver and which are used by 
appserver. afterwards appserver will use it only to describe the tables in 
relational databases appserver is using - but i think the really ""object 
oriented"" appserver will have a version number higher than 1.0 :)

definition) that is based on xml but has features lke gcd. parsing it will 
give: 1) a fixed definition of meta-tables (in gsd) - 2) filling the 
meta-tables (in gsd) - 3) definition of the tables for the actual objects (in 
gsd) - 4) eventually other things. Jason felt 
this is a ways off Jan noted that 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) was working on godl 
which would provide a super set of the features you are speaking off. At the 
moment we need a kind of gsd + calculated field definitions + method 
definitions. Oh, and a way to define types, I think that is the most important 
point in the replacement format for the old .gcd files.","2002-09-12","47"
"1481","624","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked should I do something 
before calling runForm in GFClient? the ui seems to not be setup. the only 
place I see it being resolved is in run... James Thompson (jamest) 
said he had not had a chance to look into the 
code - but IIRC you passed the form in via the run command. Marcos 
explained I needed runForm because that, since 
Jason Cater (jcater) added a way to pass parameters 
to forms (as discussed in 
) 
it's the only way to run a form from code (that is not 
a trigger) instead that using gfcvs - I also needed to move the initializatrion 
of the user interface outside the run method. He would talk to Jason 
about this.","2002-09-12","47"
"1482","625","1","While working further on 
, 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked how can I get the 
python path on win32? i.e. in normal cases this should be 
C:\python21. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) said 
i'm not sure that i understand what you 
need; but there is variable called PATH that should hold pyhton's path. 
Jan explained I need a way to access the directory 
where the config files are stored. On Unix I just use 
os.environ[""HOME""]+""gnue/etc/connections.conf"" - On windows I just want to 
replace that os.environ[""HOME""] by something else. And if I remeber right the 
settings are stored in C:\python21\gnue\etc\connections.conf - 
oh, seems, that sys.prefix provides something useful.","2002-09-13","47"
"1483","626","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said I really need a 
package format. i want to give my users two files to download. i.e. 
forms-setup.exe (or debian) and a mypackage-setup.zip and they can use the 
application without any configuration. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
he had been thinking a lot about that - I think we 
need, at a basic level, the equivalent of java's jar files He 
thinks python's standard library includes support 
for reading some archive files like zip, tar, etc - since python natively 
handles one of those file types on all platforms (we need to verify) 
I think we should start out with that. Jan noted that 
the zipfile (provides access to zip) library is 
optional (i.e. I dunno if it supported on both win32 and unix). 
Jason wished we knew how often people had python 
without the zipfile support. Alternatively, I 
wonder about using a dbm-type file for our packaging as 
it seems python always includes at least a ""dumbdbm"" 
implementation - not sure how practical that would be storing files though.... 
just a thought.","2002-09-13","47"
"1484","626","2","Jan said I think I finally understand why you 
mentioned .jar files. do you probably just don't extract it, but call all 
forms etc. from within? Jason felt something 
like that would be cool - maybe it's too premature to do that - 
but it would make packaging and redistribution really easy. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested they should be called par files 
(for package archive), but Peter Sullivan (psu) suggested 
gear files ;-) - 
GNU Enterprise ARchive files. 
Several people tried using the GEAR acronym in various phrases to see if 
it sounded cool enough.","2002-09-13","47"
"1485","626","3","Jan noted to implement that .jar file thing, 
we would just need to patch that openResource procedure a bit :) 
Jason agreed - it would be that easy - /me forgot 
everything uses the openResource call Jan said 
it would be something like opening a url 
like ""gear://accounting_base/currency/currency.gfd"" - which would access 
the file currency.gfd at path currency/ in the accounting_base.gear 
file. This would make using Navigator easy, 
because the path wouldn't change. 
Jason agreed - the packager could change absolute 
references to gear:// references - of course, if you use the Project support 
(when it comes about) in Designer, it'll handle it too :). Jan 
thought that packages need a special file 
which descibes the content of the package and on which packages it 
depends Daniel felt this sounds like a 
deb ;) Jan agreed - only it's a gear! 
:) - /me just don't know if that special 
file could be in the same format as a project definition file?
which would make packaging quite easy :)","2002-09-13","47"
"1486","626","4","
The next day, Jan asked where should 
be the repository for GEAR files? Peter preferred 
~/gnue/package over ~/gnue/gear as makes 
it easier to guess what a gear file is w/o having to RTFM. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked we're 
discussing already how to distribute our unlayed eggs? :) 
Jan said he had written a patch to read 
gfd/grd etc. from a zip file. I.e. installing apps is just moving the 
GEAR file into your repository - you can even open a gear with navigator 
and a GPD file representing the GEAR content is created on the 
fly.","2002-09-13","47"
"1487","626","5","
Some days later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked 
what is gear? Daniel replied 
our super duper packaing format for 
gnue files - like Java has 
jar, we have gear. Derek doesnt 
like much of anything that starts 'like java's .....' ;). 
Jason explained I can put all the 
gnue resources for a particular project in a 
.gear file and change the file references in the Navigator .gpd from 
absolute to gear:// - and all the GNue tools can work - just like it 
was a normal file on my system.","2002-09-13","47"

Phil Cole (filc) asked can the stuff about copying 
gnue.conf be removed from setup-cvs.py now that gnue.conf is optional? 
Peter Sullivan (psu) suggested well, it's only 
optional if all the default values the app assumes are acceptable - 
which, for anyone using a non-US character set, is immediately untrue. 
Jason Cater (jcBookstore) explained by running any of 
the client tools with the --configuration-options flag it will give you a 
formatted list of all valid options and the default value.","2002-09-13","47"

was curious if /usr/share/dcl/ is

the proper place? (re: debian) Peter Sullivan (psu) referred to

saying there had been a long discussion 
about where the Debianised DCL should put attatchments - 
the consensus had been to put them in /var/spool, as they 
represented work to be done in the future, as per the Debian 
guidelines. Derek said for now i put 
that stuff in /var/tmp/dcl/tmp/ - the temp files - certainly we 
can move it to spool easily. The other stuff is permanent
- so shouldnt be in sppol.","2002-09-14","47"

other interested developers in Europe to get in touch. Jason Cater

"1493","631","1","Referring to nstti, the abstraction of curses that 
Gontran Zepeda (gontran) had been looking at using to further 
develop the text-only GNUe Forms client, as discussed in 

and previous threads, 
Phil Cole (filc) reported that nstti 
does not work on redhat7.3 (python2.2 rpm) ... 
However, he had tested it on 
debian 3.0 and it's fine !! both python2.1 and python2.2. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said debian 
rocks man ;) - is it a good thing you have deadcat around for testing 
though - no developers here uses it ;). Phil felt that 
if gnue is going to be for big corps then it 
needs to run on deadcat - since that's where the support contracts 
are. Daniel was not convinced.","2002-09-14","47"
"1494","631","2","
The next day, Phil asked any objections to using 
curses.panel 
module, seems to work better than some of the hacks in nstti? 
Jason noted that curses.panel doesn't appear 
to be in Python 2.0 - when we started 
doing the NSTTI support, there was no curses.panel. This would 
mean we just state that to use Curses interfacem, 
you must have python 2.1 installed, as opposed to the normal 
minimum of python 2.0. Later, he asked 
so, are you going to have our curses support 
working in time for the weekend release? Phil said he 
very very very much doubt it :) - still learning 
python, GNUe, curses and nstti... so probably not.","2002-09-14","47"
"1495","631","3","Later, Jason confirmed that the cvs code at 
forms/src/uidrivers/nstti was the most recent version - 
someone else was working on that - 
but I haven't seen them in quite a while. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) noted curses programming 
in python is suspiciously painless.. Later, Phil asked 
grrrr.. how do you get vi to autoindent in 
tabs... James Thompson (jamest) helpfully suggested 
alias vi emacs. Phil noted 
that parts of this file are tabs, others 
are spaces... and asked is there a 
policy? Jason said not, but tradition 
dictates 2 spaces - however, we 
won't turn away contributions - well, as long as they follow our 
goals. Phil said he was pretty much 
removing SIOControl from nstti - color sucks. He 
explained Screen I/O Control.... basically 
handles any screen printing/color/non-ascii chars - It assumed only 
one window - and that isn't the case with curses.panel.","2002-09-14","47"
"1496","631","4","Later, Phil asked What's the max extent of 
a form... i.e. is there standard room left for rows a menubar, or a 
form title? /me guesses 80x24. He also 
found why nstti doesn't work on RedHat... it's 
actually gnome-terminal's fault, konsole, xterm are ok.","2002-09-14","47"

widgets currently supported, GFLabel, GFBox, GFPage, GFForm, GFButton 
& GFScrollbar? Marcos Dione (StyXman) added 
GFEntry and asked 
you doing nstti code? Phil said he 
was trying... got it changed over to use 
curses.panel ok, but I think the character processing in nstti needs 
to be changed - a control can't handle anything it's not told about, I 
think I should make it bubble down keypresses to the page or window 
underneath. This will allow changing of page (say CTRL-arrowleft/right) 
or menu (say Ctrl-M).","2002-09-14","47"
"1498","631","6","
The next day, Phil asked how ""moving"" the 
focus works. - In wx and gtk the form is initialised and when activated 
the ""mainloop"" is started - How then does GNUe forms control tab/focus 
order? Jason Cater (jcater) explained 
gtk and wx are UI toolkits - part of their 
responsibility is controlling focus/tab order - we do intercept their 
attempts to move the focus and create a nextEntry event. 
Phil said that, to replicate this, I think I 
need re-do the focus/tab side of nstti - /me is checking out curses 
libform - /me sees you've already been down this road - 
pyncurses!!","2002-09-14","47"

btw. at the moment reports seems to 
be broken, is that right or did I just call it wrong?

but nothing truly groundbreaking. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
said the next step for appserver would be 
0.0.2 but some features mentioned in the ROADMAP for 0.0.2 are not 
ready. Derek Neighbors (derek) suggested
feature releases should be x.x.0 - 
bug releases shoudl be x.x.X but 
until you get into  minor version numbers
i would say its up to you :) Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
FWIW I don't think that we had much 
progress in appserver since 0.0.1. However, Jan felt 
appserver should released together with 
the rest, because there is an important fix in RPC abstraction. 
Derek agreed there was little harm in 
releasing - as long as SOMETHING has changed. 
Jason said ok, but 0.0.2... is that the 
final answer? Jan noted acording 
to the ROADMAP it should be a 0.0.1.5, but I think its easier to 
change the roadmap :). Several people tried to produce even
more dotted or hyphenated version numbers.","2002-09-15","47"

if there was a fix then i am ok 
with 0.0.2 if somebody can do the necessary work for the release -

was going to take responsibility for the 
release procedures i.e., changelog, announcements, et al - 
although someone else will need to help with the actual docs
wrt if they are out of date or not. Jan said 
I will do some appserver code cleanup 
this week.. Jason made the official announcement 
that We will be attempting a release of 
the tools by weeks end. If you are aware of outstanding bugs 
that are not in DCL, please report them. (Or better yet, send a 
patch!) Also, if there are any

more work on designer before release? Jason said 
a little - at a minimum, I'm moving 
schema.parser into common.schema - plus of course bugfixes. 
Jan asked whether I don't need to send some 
obvious bug reports to dcl ? Jason said it 
couldn't hurt - as I haven't sat down to test designer yet - so having a

sql is a pretty good language. Jason Cater (jcater) agreed - 
the cool thing about sql is I can teach it to my power 
users and get them out of my hair when they need custom queries :)
Nick noted that Interestingly, sqlite supports unions 
and such - useful. Phil Cole (filc) noted I've 
tried to do that... it's ok for single table queries... but just watch the 
queries blow for multitable stuff where they forget to link the 
tables. Nick said sqlite consistantly suprises 
me as to how much power it has in its query engine. Jason, sniffing the 
possibility of another database driver to add to GNUe Common, asked 
are you using sqlite w/gnue ? Nick said 
No - but I am using it with python. The python

where its at ( i think i set up the necessary temp directories and 
such) but i think the email aliases and the perl code needs be

it doesn't remember what refered it to the log in page - so it 
goes directly to the home page. I think DCL should remember the 
referer - and redirect you there after the login. 
Instead I have to wade thru my 
tickets/screens finding the ticket I wanted to view.

John initially suggested you're already using

consider gtk or qt to really be xplatform - w/o a boatload of

wxpython sucking on debian? 
was a good enough reason. Jason said I 
need a better reason than that :( - as unlike forms - designer 
is HEAVILY dependent on whatever toolkit it is written to - 
that's why we chose wx. Also, another 
difference between forms and designer is it's important for forms 
to run everywhere (curses, win32, gtk, palm, bayonne, etc) -

old, I wonder?. He just deleted those two 
loginData.setdefault() lines - as they look completely out of place to 
me. Jan also said The other bug of 
mysql is that it creates endless resultsets. should be a problem in 
_getNextRecord() - I know that it worked 2 month ago (although I 
don't know why and what are the changes).","2002-09-16","47"
"1520","644","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked what about the 
sample directory? Should samples stay in each applications tree or should 
they be moved to sample directory containing all (forms, reports, 
navigator) kind of samples together? or should we split all samples up in 
(working/usefull) and (testing/for fun)  and move the first ones in the 
package tree and leave the testing and fun samples in each applications 
sample directory? Jason Cater (jcater) said 
I think a samples/ directory in the main gnue/ 
tree would be best. Phil Cole (filc) agreed - 
speaking as a newbie i'd think that would be easy 
to find too. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
samples DEFINITELY need to be outside the 
tool trees - only because for debian packaging samples become a separate 
package. usable vs. notusable shouldnt happen - either we deem a sample 
useful and keep it up to date or remove it from the tree :).","2002-09-16","47"
"1521","644","2","Later, Jan said he was beginning to 
populate the sample directory. I will 1. in case of a form uses a 
database I change the name of the database connection
to ""gnue_sampledb"" - 2. check for every 
form/report if its working and add a README, about what it should do/will 
do - 3. change to a more consistent directory structure Jason 
asked why #1 ? I wonder if a simple ""samples"" 
wouldn't be enough? Jan said samples 
would be ok too, I just want to have all samples use the SAME db name - 
I don't like to edit the connection file for every new sample I'm 
trying. Jason agreed - gnue_sampledb 
just seemed a little convoluted.","2002-09-16","47"
"1522","644","3","
The next day, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked 
if this kind of toplevel samples would be ok, 
or not, critics comments :). Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said 
works for me -  THOUGH - it might be better 
to kill applications and historical_examples. Eventually i want test 
cases and tutorials to run off a nice gpd (GNUe Process 
Definition file, as used by Navigator) so 
that you get a tree list of test cases to walk through - or you get a 
walk through tutorial - MUCH like the wxWindows demo/sample. 
Jan noted if you pack the whole sample 
directory in a zip file, and rename it to samples.gear, you can get 
that navigator file automaticly builded. just call gncvs 
samples.gear. He agreed on killing 
applications and historical sample, but would move contact manager to 
packages, and application/location to tutorials. I hope that we have 
a gnue schema installer in the next release, then we can throw all 
the sql files in the samples directory away :) and just 
use the same .gsd (GNUe Schema Definition) format for all databases 
supported by GNUe Common.","2002-09-16","47"
"1523","645","1","It was asked why GNUe used python. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
if not python, then what?. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) suggested scheme or 
ruby - ruby is probably the only really comparable language in wide 
use. Derek said ruby i can 
understand - scheme you are sick. He asked 
why on earth would you use C to do 
business applications?  - C is nearly unmaintainable (Well not as 
bad as perl) - and the performance gain starts to become minimal
when the codig gets bad He felt that C was 
highly unproductive. Nick 
agreed - I'd be like months behind schedule 
if I werce doing my work project in C - because you have to think 
about structure and form constantl/y to get a good reselt - or you 
end up in HELL - and in python I just need to concentrate on one 
object ata  time and I don't have to THINK about it. 
Derek also felt C was a large barrier 
to entry - python is 100 times 
more readable and simple to learn than C. He was
not knocking C - it has its place - 
i wouldnt advocate rewritting linux in python or anything. 
However, i say for business applications 
its too unproductive *(or about anything gui) - if it needs a gui C 
might not be best choice (though thats not a hard and fast 
rule).","2002-09-16","47"
"1524","645","2","He noted that GNUe had been started 
in C at first - and then  didnt like what we were doing with glade - 
so we moved to wxWindows (which was C++ or python) - we all didnt 
like C++ - so we thought we woudl give python a try. Hated it for 
a week - and then fell in love. Then recently after a year of using 
python - we decided to scrap our application server written in C - 
and migrate it to python, as discussed in 
 
- doing so actually gave us a 
performance gain :).","2002-09-16","47"
"1525","645","3","He emphasised i dont think any 
of the core developers 'hate' C - just we dont feel its correct 
tool for GNUe - now, java, thats a language we hate ;)
Nick said java has good and bad 
points. Derek said he has 
aversion to perl for some reason mostly because 
it scares my children when i have it open in an editor. 
Nick said I love perl for certain 
things - I'd like a bastard child of perl and python sometimes.
I especially like perl for torturing small animals and

GNUe is using quite a bit of python not covered in the *easy*

think we might be pressing python as hard as any other project - 
probably almsot more so than zope as of late. Phil said he 
was young jedi - learning to use the 
source. Derek said actually 
we have decent teaching code in there - and yoda, er jcater is 
pretty good teacher if you ask him to explain the ways of the

you mean, like Navigator :) 
Derek Neighbors (derek) agreed - if you 
mean yes navigator but you dont like navigator discuss why you dont 
like navigator - as the right answer might be to fix navigator not 
gut forms :). Marcos asked does 
navigator still rely in the connections login? 'cause we need other 
kind of login. one based on a database content and not a database 
auth. I mean, how would you set up different user for an app made in 
gnue? creating users in the dbengine? Jason said 
this is a completely different problem - 
you need an authentication plugin. He had done some work on 
this previously - I need to dig that out - 
but we have hooks in place to do this - let me dig up the 
details.","2002-09-16","47"

The next day, Jason announced we now have 
custom authenticators in common - so you can authenticate against NIS,

how hard woudl it be to add in PAM? -

I can make patches with 'cvs diff' or 
'diff -Naur'. Jason Cater (jcater) said he was not sure which 
was better - We really need to have a README 
for patches that tells people the preferred way to send in 
patches. Phil Cole (filc) said ""cvs diff 
-c"" Is what i've read before, but Marcos noted that this 
uses non-unified diffs, have line nubers 
'harcoded', so they go where they 'want' to go, whereas  
diff -Naur (like the scroll.patch I sent) 
have context, so patch can find where it should go even if is not 
where it say it should... Jason said 
then I think I'd prefer the diff -Naur. 
He suggested can we add that somewhere to the 
web site i.e., ""Preferred way to send patches"" - or maybe that's a FAQ 
entry?.","2002-09-16","47"
"1530","648","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked what do you 
think of letting programmer disable entries @ runtime? 
Jason Cater (jcater) said I think that's a 
needed feature - one we've been discussing a while - but haven't had 
time to add. He thought all that has 
to happen is add an enable() and disable() trigger namespace for entries 
and buttons that sets the .readonly flag - I think it'll be as simple as 
that - as the nextEntry() and previousEntry() code checks the status of 
.readonly. Marcos asked about on whow 
disable certain rows of multirow'ed entries? He thought this 
might avoid the bug we found re: clicking in 
the wrong row, as referred to in 
. 
Jason said he would rather find the cause of 
the row selection problem.","2002-09-16","47"
"1531","648","2","Marcos felt that disabling rows that are 
not 'valid' for input *yet* is also a good feature. Jason 
agreed, but I think that'd be a function of 
the UI driver - not of a trigger coded by the programmer. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) suggested what about 
using a different color for rows that don't have data in it and are 
not editable. (a different color like dark grey) Jason said 
I've actually wanted that too for a while - 
just never got around to it - y'all should open these up as work 
orders in DCL. Marcos asked ain't 
that the same to 'disable' them? Jason said 
I don't think wx greys out disable fields - 
I could be wrong Phil Cole (filc) pointed out that GNUe 
needed to be able to do this on a text interface.
Not sure if colour is a good idea. Jason said he 
would foresee the shading as an added feature 
on UI's that support it - but certainly shouldn't be the ""primary"" 
method of disabling - as like you say, on curses that wouldn't make 
sense. Jan said I think, if you use 
a text interface you won't use your mouse often, so the problem of 
clicking in row 3 instead of row one wouldn't occure very often. 
Phil agreed - A disabled object should not be 
able to get focus. Jason said he may 
try to hack this in before the next release.","2002-09-16","47"

, 
Jason Cater (jcater) said he thinks I've 
settled on LanePOS for his own personal use 
until I get GNUe POS working - 
/me fully intends on doing a GNUe PoS 
at some point - just not tonight. He noted that 
LanePOS was 
GPL (of course) - and includes a curses 
and TK module. This would also probably 
spur GNUe Integrator - so I can get sales out of and products into 
Lane - and sales into Acclite. /me also desparately needs to be able to 
load data files (CSV, etc) into my database at work (and on some side 
projects) - and I think integrator should handle that too.","2002-09-16","47"
"1533","650","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) pasted an e-mail he had received asking 
about web enabled accounting 
software - he was am at a crux 
to i respond with an acclite response and fact it 
will be attempting to put back into nola tree - or do i not mention 
at all - etc - part of me wonders are we better off just forking
since it seems nola isnt much maintained anyhow - and doing more to 
'market it'. Jason Cater (jcater) put on his Austin Powers 
glasses and said fork it, baby!
Derek noted we have been receiving 
patches and applying them :) Jason asked 
does the FSF copyright assignment cover the 
patches to that? Derek said technically 
yes - IF we put it under GNU Enterprise - as i went lawyer like on the 
assignments - and have folks assign to GNU Enterprise - which means 
ANYTHING under the GNUe umbrella would be covered (as thought of 
getting more than one assignment seemed painful). He noted 
that assignment was less of an issue with acclite 
in sense its already tainted with base 
code from Nola owned by Noguska 
that isnt assigned - though i would 
PREFER all new code to it be assigned  - as at somepoint new code 
will supercede old code. What was more important was the 
marketing message, i.e. Acclite as 
part of GNUe but not an 'official' GNUe Accounting 
Package.","2002-09-17","47"
"1534","650","2","The other issue was that he was looking at developing some 
backend stuff for 
sales order, shipping, purchase 
order, A/R, A/P, shopping cart etc - 
wondering if this should be official 
unofficial gnue stuff ;) - or official gnue stuff - as i need to start 
some marketing campaigns for a few things. However, 
one of the tenets of gnue is umbrella for 
enteprise apps written w/ or w/o framework and second tenet is community 
of gnue apps whether official packages or not. 
Right now today i would say the 
'backend stuff' was NOT going to be final 
package for areas like GNUe Supply Chain or Sales - 
though it may 'evolve' into that, probably 
wouldnt market as such. Jason felt the same applied to 
acclite - not an official GNUe Financials package, 
but it would be a great package to have under 
our umbrella - i.e., the GNUe Accounting package for SME. 
Derek explained we are faced with about 
3 different shops needing almost identical solution - we have to 
start somewhere and SAP equivalent isnt it :). Jason said 
we need to find a POS to bring under our 
wings too :).","2002-09-17","47"
"1535","650","3","Derek said we are faced with what do 
we do with this backend we are writing - 
do we make it part of GNUe - 
if so is it like acclite and 'start paks'? or is it the basis for the 
OFFICIAL gnue packages - we have real companies committed to using 
it - and already some code (all under GPL) - we venture others would 
be HIGHLY interested - and would like to start marketing it - 
but are at a crux on approach. Peter Sullivan (psu) 
felt the key thing is to get apps - 
and pref official GNUe Apps - even if they are more basic than where 
we want to end up. Derek agreed, but 
i dont want to look like a quickbooks 
replacement (As an end goal) - by putting sme type packages out as 
'official'. Unlike acclite though this backend stuff is all gnue 
based - i.e. using the framework Hans Kugler (LuftHans) 
said we need a good, Free Software accounting 
package for small to medium businesses. If acclite can get that done 
quickly, then I ask that acclite get fixed -  
is there a reason you can't have acclite as 
the 'quickbooks replacement', then work on whatever it is as the big 
package, or maybe make an accheavy...","2002-09-17","47"
"1536","650","4","Derek said im not worried about 
acclite :) - i see it as before like DCL - a non GNUe Framework app 
pointed to as part of gnue - migrating towards the framework slowly. 
Im more concerned about the backend stuff i discussed - 
which will i assume start to replace or merge with parts of acclite
as when looking at A/P, A/R that is one area we though, we should 
really just reuse acclite - for a quick advancement. 
Peter asked To what extent does the 
backend stuff conflict with our plans for GNUe Financials?
I.e. modular design means that Derek's back-end stuff  
it can talk to either acclite or GNUe 
Fin. Derek said there was no conflict - 
what im envisioning is the backend stuff 
is exactly what i want gnue to do long term - its just starting out 
small - i.e. baby steps - 
current time lines dictate fully functional 
backend from sales order to warehouse to ups to door to invoice to 
payment - w/in 3 - 6 months minimum - without a 'ton' of bells and 
whistles - which from what i have seen just on the local LUG list 
here - people are darn near dying for - and its not gnucash small 
business or sql-ledger or the likes that is basically accounting with 
some invoicing features but full cycle supply chain stuff - 
that is HIGHLY extendable quickly. Peter felt that 
as long as we managed expectations (e.g. 
keep version numbers under 1.0.0) I don't see why we can't call what 
you are working on GNUe SCM 0.1, GNUe Inventory 0.1 etc - 
i.e it's there, use it, but it ain't 1.0 functionality yet - and yes, 
we do accept patches. After all, the tools were pretty basic to start 
with but still useful within their limitations.","2002-09-17","47"
"1537","650","5","Derek said we have this stuff in 
private cvs currently - i suppose before i go committing a ton more 
crap - we will need to decide if we want this else where. /me 
was thinking if it were to remain 'non official' it could stay where 
it is BUT if its 'official' i want assignments and it should be in 
savannah and then a whole other argument can ensue on what folders 
names and such to use :) - the bad thing is because of timelines a 
lot of stuff cant be discussed in length to make most optimal 
decisions - another reason i questioned should it be official 
gnue. Peter felt sometimes the 
only way to prove something is a bad decision is to make it 
;-). Jason proposed making acclite 
GNUe's SME entry-level accounting package 
(at least until our main package gets underway) - and that we put it 
on savannah (where GNUe's main CVS was) 
but not under gnue/ - perhaps 
gnue-acclite. Peter suggested 
GNU-ANQ (acclite's not 
quickbooks).","2002-09-17","47"
"1538","650","6","Derek was not sure how the back-end stuff should be presented, 
for instance on the website - if they were not to be official 
GNUe packages, i just want our home 
page to not look like we dont have anything if we start to have 
somethign :) - but dont want people to be confused that its the 
end game. Jason agreed - that's 
WHY I keep saying ""lite"" - and that it's nothing more than 
accounting Derek said well 
thats what i have to deliver - so thats what im thinking of 
:). Jason said you will be 
delivering backend services - that at the moment interface with 
the SME accounting package.  Derek asked 
but how do we do this web page wise?
how do i market this if its not from the main gnue pages? 
Peter suggested split the site
 - have a prominent link to ""Friends of GNUe"" 
Various web adresses (serious or not) were suggested, but Derek 
liked lite.gnuenterprise.org.

Free software world? embrace-and-extend? Derek said 
if you cant beat them, extend them - 
sadly in our case its laziness vs greed ;).","2002-09-17","47"
"1539","650","7","Jason asked what's wrong with putting 
it on the GNUe pages? but labeling it like I said - ""SME"" or such - 
as long as it's clear that this is not ""THE"" gnue accounting 
package - but a slimmed down version - GNUe Mom-and-Pop. 
Peter suggested some text along the lines of 
GNUe SME is an umbrella for GNUe packages 
aimed at SME. At the moment, the SME packages are in advance of the 
official ones.  This should change over time. We are/are not aware 
of any limitations in GNUe SME that make it unsuitable for larger 
biz, but that's not the target market.","2002-09-17","47"
"1540","650","8","Peter noted that From what I can 
remember of the GNUe GL spec, I would guess acclite probably has 
more functionality anyway - but it's been almost a year since I 
grokked it. Jason said I personally 
think we should remove some features of acclite if we make it our 
official SME - e.g., payroll - as I think that'll be overcomplicating 
the initial package.","2002-09-17","47"
"1541","651","1","Jason Cater (jcater) wished our schema 
stuff (GNUe Schema Definitions - .gsd) 
didn't depend on XSLT :( - yet another 
dependency to be installed before you can play - plus apparently 
ppl are haveing trouble with pysablot on Win32 machines. He 
saw XSLT as a short-term solution - not a 
long-term one - so I guess it works now Derek Neighbors 
(dneighbo) was not really pro writing 
our own - it works VERY well 
for gsd stuff - where i think it will likely fall more short is 
reports - and there i see it as just one of many options. 
Jason said that eventually .gsd support will 
become an extension of the dbdrivers and the dbdrivers will be able 
to create tables directly based on gsd files. Derek was not 
keen as one of the powerful things to 
me is that for OTHER projects to adopt this currently all they need 
is an XSLT parser - in the future if all they need to adopt it is 
GNUe Common we lose a lot of people using it. Jason felt 
that XSLT was no small barrier to 
entry!, but Derek said its 
smaller and less 'political' than requiring common. He 
agreed i dont like it the dependency
- maybe we can make it like reports - and allow xslt to still be 
used - or use native gnue components - i think we need to be 
careful to try to use (or be standards compatiable) where 
possible. Jason said that .gsd was not a standard - 
it's something we came up with - 
I'm all for other projects being able to benefit from it
- but only to the point that it still fulfills our needs. 
Derek said i meant that XSLT is a 
standard - gnue common parser is not. Jason did not see 
see how that relates at all - 
then let's get rid of GNUe Forms and do an XSLT engine. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said we need more 
than the xslt solution. The xslt solution is good and important. 
f.e. for populating empty databases, but we need something like 
a real schema installer for upgrades - 
a real schema installer could tell 
you the differences between the actual schema in the database 
and the schema in the GSD file. Derek said 
im not AGAINST moving away from XSLT 
though we should probably still support/maintain it. 
Jason agreed - I just said at some point 
dbdrivers will support it natively - I never said you couldn't 
have xslt as well.","2002-09-17","47"
"1542","652","1","John Lenton (Chipaca) said we need to add 
support for tables that don't update their fields via an update, but 
via marking the row as 'old' (via a timestamp) - we were about to do 
this via a 'papo' dbdriver, but we thought maybe 
it could be taken to a point where other people could use it. 
In papo tables that should behave like this have two fields, a start_t 
and an end_t, but that should be configurable if we were to make it 
part of gnue. This involved tables 
that keep a historic record of themselves, and as such don't ever 
update, but mark rows as no longer valid - thus you can have a snapshot 
of the system at any previous point in time. Jason Cater 
(jcater) thought this sounded like a 
transactional system - I do that here at work with database-level 
triggers - I'm not sure how to do that cleanly at the client 
level. John explained that their database driver would 
say 'this table uses whatever', and which 
columns do the dirty work - we could come up with something very, very, 
very ugly - and it would still be nicer than triggers in the database 
:). Phil Cole (filc) thought that 
transaction history should be handled by the appserver stuff... not 
the db level.  e.g. Sales Order History, Audit Trail. 
Jason did not have a clean solution that I 
like :( John suggested ok, we'll come 
up with something semi-clean and push it at you ]:) - We need it for 
papo, but as I say, we were going to do it out of gnue completely, so 
if you don't like it it's still A-ok - just thtat we thought it might 
be of more general use.","2002-09-17","47"
"1543","652","2","Later, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) suggested That 
transaction stuff can be added quite fast to the application server. If 
papo don't want to additionaly start appserver, there will be a way using 
that loopback RPC driver to start appserver every time you start up forms, 
as an additional thread.. Derek Neighbors (derek) was 
not sure i like that solution - one of the 
tenents of GNUe is - productss work alone or together. Of course common 
is the exception, and designer isnt necessary much if dont have at  least 
one other product installed. But the itdea was you would not be required 
to have appserver ifyou didnt want it - you would nto be required ot have 
reports if you didnt want it. I have no problem making transactions and 
such happen in appserver, but i dont think that you can require appserver 
to have transactions.","2002-09-17","47"

runs on WinNT/2000, Firebird seems to be a better choice. 
Jason felt these were two different classes 
of databases - if you are wanting a compact database SAP-DB is 
definitely not what you want. Derek said 
firebird imho is far from 'lite' which 
is a good thing not a bad one - but 
if you are using a SQL level db on 95/98

Stuart Bain (stbain) said he was introduced 
to XUL a week or so ago by a co-contractor at one of our mutual 
customers - seems like it would actually fit quite well. It's not browser 
based - rather, a cross platform GUI builder - and now that Mozilla is 
moving towards MPL/LGPL/GPL tri-licensing it was compatible 
with the GNU General Public License (GPL) that GNUe used. 
granted, the databindings are not quite as 
strong yet, but from what I've seen so far, it's a very feature rich 
language. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
a lot of it goes to 3 years ago when we 
made a decision. Part of the problem is also mozilla and gecko arent 
well separate (though much better now) - and requiring mozilla as a 
'client' is a bit much. The databinding isnt even on the roadmap -
where in gnue the databinding IS the product. He noted 
fwiw: you could use navigator in same 
way you want to use mozilla - i.e. it could read gfd's over http just 
fine - and you have an 'internet' application. I'm just seeing NO real 
value in scrapping all our work - and starting with XUL and having to 
do their databinding for them - 
I do see value in someone over there 
getting head out of sand and looking to add XPCOM to gnue-common
- then use gnue-common databasde for bindings - and even possibly 
making a forms client that renders XUL. He was not convinced 
by arguments that XUL was a standard - XUL 
is a netscape standard - just like GFD is a GNUe based standard 
and currently only GNUe focuses on 
databinding - XUL does all this great 
databinding to RDF/RSS which is basically XML data streams, not what an 
enterprise will be storing its data in and horribly slow for large 
data heaps.","2002-09-17","47"

No such file or directory:

better not - or I may be kicking someone's 
ass - the DTD is for documentation only i.e., it's a reference - 
it's not actually used by the code. Marcos confirmed that 
the form definition had an XML DOCTYPE declaration in it - if this
was not commented out, *something* tries 
to load the dtd... Jason wondered 
where'd that <!--DOCTYPE--> come 
from? Marcos guessed emacs - 
although he did not use it, other people who might have been 
working on the form did. He deleted the DOCTYPE line and everything

Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked re: enabling 
and disabling widgets from triggers, don't you think that some 'bridge' 
is necessary from the GFthing to the UIthing and even to the 
widget? Jason Cater (jcater) said the bridge was 
events - we are event-driven. 
Marcos asked so, 
the widget (or the UIthing) should 'listen' for a 'disable' 
event? ...and should 'demultiplex' the event to the right widget? 
Jason said yes, but we usually use a proxy event 
- the UIdriver would probably listen for the event.
Marcos asked ain't events a little 
overkill for enabling/disabling widgets? or is it the way to make GF 
things talk to UI things? Jason said the 
latter - and I don't think it's overkill - as you just communicate with 
the GF* widgets to enable/disable them - but at the same time, if the 
underlying UI wants to grey them out, it could also listen for the 
event - it's what events are made for! :) He explained 
the trigger will be at the GFEntry level - 
i.e., it would be GFEntry.enable() and if 
anything wanted to listen in it could (such as the graying out). 
Marcos asked how the UI things should be able 
to talk to its widget. afaik, the only way to reach a widget is to 
traverse the tree starting from the _form of a UIForm object?
Jason did not see why this was necessary - 
the UIdriver will listen for an event 
itself then contact the widgets. ","2002-09-18","48"

Some days later, 
Jason Cater (jcater) was working on the

 I should be releasing Forms 0.3.1, Designer 
0.3.1, Common 0.3.1, AppServer 0.0.2, Reports 0.0.2, and Navigator 
0.0.1. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) asked philosophically 
what qualifies as a new major 
version? Jason said new features 
:) - the only thing new in forms is the GTK driver - this is basically 
a housecleaning release once I look at it. Now, designer did undergo 
vast changes - it's probably worthy of a 0.4.0 - but I hate to jump it 
ahead of the rest of them. He looked at 
common's changelog - 
if there's more in common than I realize, it 
might push forms to 0.4.0 Andrew felt that 
only the schema support is 'major'. 
Jason was torn as 
I think designer is worthy of a 0.4.0 - 
but I don't want to rush it ahead of the others. Poor form's changelog
is depressing. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested 
go with the gut ;) but Jason said

that's irrelevant.","2002-09-19","48"

though. Andrew said he would want Nick Rusnov (nickr) to check them 
before he tried to get someone 
to put them into sid - jbailey or nickr can do that. He 
asked package names like gnue-forms, 
gnue-appserver ok? gnue-appserver should conflict & 
replace the Debian package for the old, depreciated

gnue-common will be one package

some 
documentation on how automake and 
python work together, for any who might want to be convinced to 
Come Back To The Light Side Of The Force.. Andrew asked 
how will it go for windows 
packagine? Jeff said that he believed that the GNUe core 
developers were willing yo require cygwin 
for developpers although not for 
end users. End users on Microsoft Windows would probably 
be using some pre-compiled set-up. Andrew noted 
they've been using mcmillan & 
inno.","2002-09-19","48"

automake is that it's *nix-specific - which we are not.

program which was part of the rationale for developing 
our setup-cvs.py script for setting 
up the CVS version of GNUe, but 
/me doesn't really like any of our options 
:(. Jeff felt that the best option is to 
use an install shield like program for Windows users. Jason said 
we currently use a system like 
that but the users have to install 
the old fashioned way if they use anything other than postgres / 
mysql due to licensing problems in adding 
proprietary drivers to the bundle. 
Even then - if we made it work that way - 
we are maintaining several installer programs :'(. Jeff felt
You are in any instance: Debian, REdHat, 
Windows. In none of those cases should the user need to do anything 
other than install the compiled python files through some 
non-shell method. The trick is what builds those methods. 
distutils/automake or whatever should be the tool that gets invoked 
in the creation of the installer, either through generating spec 
files, debian subdirs, or whatever type of script is required for 
the windows installer. Jason said 
that sounds great coming from a 
linux-centric background - it just seems soo out of place to be 
using automake for stuff that isn't being compiled, given 
that python was an interpreted language.","2002-09-19","48"

Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said it seems, that 
you can access a parameter in a condition tag in forms too, 
pasting some sample text. Marcos noted that the Forms parameter code 
was different from the Reports parameters code, which had both a 
GRStubParam and a GRConditionParam. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
that reports has two types of ""output"" 
parameters - one in the <condition> trees (which is 
GRConditionParam) and one in the layout/output code. Both share 
most of their code via GRStubParam. He did not see any need 
for something similar for Forms, which should only need one type of 
parameters.","2002-09-22","48"
"1586","671","2","
The next day, Marcos said that the example Jan gave 
works, but not when using a 
<cparam> in <contidions>.... Jan 
asked you don't have provided 
a ""default"" attribute to the parameter?. Marcos 
replied nope, but I'm passing 
a value thru the command line... Without the 
cparamm tag, it worked, despite the fact that 
both cparam and getParameter call 
GFForm.getParameter. Jan said it 
seems that the parameter is used 
before the form is finally setup. i.e. its loaded by the 
condition before GFInstance.setForm() is called.
Marcos also reported that when I 
run another form with runForm, I have problems 
passing parameters.","2002-09-22","48"
"1587","672","1","Further to 
, 
John Lenton (Chipaca) asked would adding a delegates 
system to dbsig be cool with y'all?. Federico Heinz (perlhead) 
explained It's a way to create classes whose 
instances solve a general problem but provides slots for client code to 
customize the functionality. The idea would be that the dbisg 
class, which defines messages for inserting, 
updating, and generally mangling records in the database would no 
longer do this directly, but would keep a list of delegates. 
A delegate is simply any object that responds 
to the class' (in this case dbsig's) delegation protocol. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said I like this in theory - 
In practice, this is going to be interesting to write and maintain.
in effect, you would need more than an alternate ""insert"", ""update"", ""delete"" 
hook - you would need more a subclassed resultset. John explained 
the delegation protocol is something like: 
""I'm going to <foo>"" - ""No idea""/""Go on""/""Don't""/""I just did it"" - 
you do this to all your delegates until one of them answers something other 
than ""No idea"". Federico said that no code would be removed from 
dbisg, as the existing ""insert"" or ""update"" code would be needed for where 
a delegate told the class to perform the operation itself rather than 
delegate it. The benefit was more ability to 
add functionality to dbsig without breaking stuff nor touching dbsig. 
For instance, transaction tables (recording all the previous states of a 
row of data in the database) would be implemented 
through a class that does nothing but listen to willUpdates - It would then 
find out whether the table is ""transactional"" or not. If it's not, it'd answer 
""ask somebody else"" - So dbsig would continue to walk the list. If it is 
transactional, it would do the update/insert thing and answer ""I did it for 
you"".","2002-09-22","48"
"1588","672","2","Jason said I think I like this at first 
glance but there are a few areas I want to 
be sensitive to: 1. This is a critical part of gnue-common, where speed is 
important (think backbone of appserver and reports) so any code doesn't need 
to add a lot of bloat - 2. Odds are, the ""delegates"" will need to understand 
the dbdriver internals - so maintenance on delegates wouldn't be fun (but 
that would be the problem of the delegate writers, not me). 
He felt as long as we could do this without adding 
very much overhead - I think it might work - this will be a complex addition 
to gnue-common, though. John felt the overhead for people not using 
delegates would not be great - it would probably be 
one lookup of one array variable.","2002-09-22","48"
"1589","672","3","Jason added now, I know this isn't my problem - 
but assuming we do the delegates system, I still question how that'll solve 
your problems in adding transactional support - 
if a person updates a record you are wanting to 
just mark the existing record with an ""old"" date (or such) and start with a 
freshly inserted ""current"" row - the problem then is you have to manipulate 
the resultset's internal cache - otherwise if the user turns around and 
modifies the record again, they are doing so against an outdated 
version. Phil Cole (filc) wondered why the 
current row can't always be the up-to-date record and take, just insert a 
copy of the current row and call it the history record. 
John said we could do it either way, I guess - 
the way we had thought was such that you could get an _exact_ image of the 
system in a past time - the way you propose would be _almost_ exact, and 
the overhead is greater (on the database) - we'd have to update all the 
stuff that pointed to the old record to point to the new-but-historic 
record. Jason agreed, but I'm not sure 
you fully understand the needed coding in your delegate - you will be 
touching A LOT of internals unless you did it filc's way - /me personally 
doesn't care, as I won't be coding it :).","2002-09-22","48"
"1590","672","4","John said look at it this way: if we don't 
do it with delegates we'd have to do it _in_ dbsig. Jason said 
but my big fear is you get into this and realize 
that doing it your way isn't going to get the results you want without 
recoding dbsig again too - just something to think about. 
John said I suspect dbsig _will_ be slightly 
modified throughout - but I don't think the headhaches will come from 
there, rather from fighting the cache, as you said - I don't know, but 
isn't there a way to tell the cache it's outdated? Jason said 
I don't think there's a reliable way to do 
that.","2002-09-22","48"
"1591","672","5","Phil asked Could the history 
records be written to a seperate table by the delegate? Then you don't 
have to worry about the cache. John agreed, but felt that 
this would mean that GNUe would be dictating the form of the database. 
Jason said that the alternative - rewriting 
GNUe Forms to meet your peculiar needs might be worse - but 
not so much in this particular case, as 
transactional/history support is commonly needed. John said 
but there are about 3 decisions to make for 
transactional/history support, with a very large amount of options per 
decision, and I think gnue should support them all - and either you 
bloat up dbsig by supporting them _all_, or you add some mechanism of 
extending what you do support while at the same time providing 
extensions to cover the typical cases. The delegate both for 
doing history as part of the main table, and Phil's suggestion of 
doing history in a seperate table might should 
probably eventually become part of 
gnue anyway. Jason said all I was 
pointing out is that you might want to reconsider how you do your 
history. John said our database is 
such that doing historics in any other way is a PITA because of 
references - it was the norm rather than the exception to 
have to refer back to historic entries, hence the need to keep them 
in the same table as the live entries - otherwise, 
we'd have to do ""on update cascade"" and that 
has other security and integrity issues.","2002-09-22","48"
"1592","673","1","Jason Cater (jcater) asked Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
I notice you committing against the 
sqlite driver - are you actually using that driver?
Jan said I don't want to use it for 
anything important. But I hate it that all examples which needs 
database access don't work at once. so I think of providing a 
database file, which is already populated, with the examples. 
So you just have to start the examples up and everything is 
working. I tried to use gadfly, but gadfly don't support ""LIKE"" 
conditions, so ... :(. He asked whether 
the description of the ""configfile"" 
dbadapter should go in README.databases. Jason felt that 
a technote might make more sense 
- as the README.databases is there to 
detail to the end user what choices he has for his databases
but he was not sure. Jan said he will 
add a technote first, and move it to README.databases/obscure, when 
there are more obscure drivers like that :) - like the imap driver

closing with the 'x' of the

window but the one I wanted to close - and also closing the last 
one gives me a segmentation fault. Jason Cater (jcater) 
said the seg fault was a known problem with wxpython, but that 
the issue with closing the wrong window 
needs work. Marcos said 
that thinking about it I suppose that 
wx has problems with multiple windows with multiple toolbars, 
all with the same 'actions' Maybe that was the problem - 
as the same 'action' is defined for 
both windows....","2002-09-23","48"
"1595","675","2","
The next day, Marcos said I _think_ I 
fixed the problems with multiple windows. Well, I jusr saw that all the 
windows registered to the same wx's events. So, I added a constant per 
window. I used ... ... the instance's serial number, multiplied by 1000 
and added to wx's 'action' nunbers - where action numbers are those in ...
... EVT_MENU in UIDriver. Peter Sullivan (psu) noted 
that this will break if an individual client 
has more than 1000 windows open at once ;-) - unlikely to be a problem in 
practice. Marcos said he was not sure how to test his solution - 
the only thing I know is that closing all 
windows doesn't quit the app if opened windows >1. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) noted that if the wx 
action number is an int2 this would mean a maximum of 65536/1000 ~= 66 
possible forms instances - if we totaly move away from fixed numbers and 
just dynamicly increase that wx action number, we could possibly get much 
more instances in that actiion number address space. wx windows can handle 
it without giving fixed number.","2002-09-23","48"

It might not be so stupid an idea to go 
all Debian - and have a codename for each release set (given that the 
version numbers are and will be out of sync) - Then we could have a 
symlink for /current/ that just moved. Given the nature of this channel, 
I can imagine code names being from Star Wars rather than Toy Story ;-)

names for Tools releases, dark-side names for packages - and anaikin/vader 
for the 1.0.0 release that brings everything together ;-).

"1615","687","1","Ariel Calò (ariel_) asked how 
inheritance will be handled by appserver? There are two issues: First 
if inherited attributes are redifined as fields in the table 
corresponding to the derived class or not. Second: if methods are 
registered in geas_meta_object, and a class inherits a method there is 
need of a mechanism (like virtual table) to find it. Say 'base' defines
'foomethod()' - there is an entry in geas_meta_object with ref_oid =
goid of base. Now 'derived' inherits from base and does not redefine 
foomethod. Adding another entry in geas_meta_object with ref_oid =
goid of base is expensive. Searching for foomethod in base classes is 
also expensive. This is why vtables are for. Jan Ischebeck 
(siesel) said he first thought of doing it 
the python way, i.e. using a __getattr__ function which searches for 
everything in the base object if an attribute isn't found in the
derived object. I like the idea that methods and attributs are stored 
in the same table. If we would create a kind of vtables, that would 
mean to copy all methods from base classes into the newly created
derived object. Ariel asked it 
is possible to add another type, say vpointer, to geas_meta_object.
The value can be the goid of the method (or field) of the base table.
If the method is redifined we add a full entry - if not a vpointer - 
this is also useful for fields.","2002-10-02","50"

XML schemas to incorporate the best features of other existing XML
business libraries.. Sacha said he believed 
it grew out of 
ebXML, I think - so there will be
a registry with ubl content and basically you could reference 
them. Christian asked so, it
could be a handful of XML files that you send to a debitors or

an icon in the Windows Programs menu to open the connection.gfd Form
Definition, the new form he had written to allow users to change the
connections.conf via Forms rather than having to use a text editor.
Bajusz said he had not looked at this yet - but
making an icon on desktop is easy to any gfd - like jcater has added to
intro.gfd. Jason Cater (jcater) said it was important that the
connection.gfd was reliable if you are putting
it on the menu - /me hasn't personally had time to test it -

yes, it works if i use ""setup.py install""

the placement.gfd fails too with 'There are

yep. The only strange thing is, that it

Peter Sullivan (psu) pointed out that the ISO standard for 
Javascript was ECMAScript -
So I guess that way to phrase it is 
that a GNUe web client should use a sub-set of EMEAscript

Microsoft's JScript.","2002-10-04","50"
"1642","698","5","Earlier, Charles 
said he was leaning toward this: any 
web-based forms/reports/navigator client needs to be completely
written in javascript.. with xmlrpc and http/cgi backend 
connectivity. I think seisel has begun this, but he said the cgi 
would still lay out the form, but it would be more portable if
javascript did it. To get any 
sort of persistent-like activity requires javascript/dhtml/iforms
- but if possible it makes sense to build in xmlrpc (being done
already).. and you might as well buildin form layout. Then for 
2-tier connectivity it would require a simple cgi engine. 
cgi<->db engine. He explained that iforms was 
some javascript functionality that I 
looked into a little bit.. for creating dynamic forms. that way, 
all you gotta do is dump the javascript code onto a web page, and 
you have a forms client. if everything were xmlrpc. and it seems 
some people have tied javascript to connect to databases which
is interesting, but seems risky. M$ has created libraries for 
this. Daniel suggested use
PSP and Ecma for the gui - less 
code to write as you can invoke gnue common. Peter agreed

non-python Forms clients is to seek to use GNUe

it's a good idea to take a non-python
browser-hosted route in the first palce :) He appeciated 
the need for a web-browser interface of some kind, but 
GNUe is SO state-based - it will require
a persistent backend. He had done 
some
notes on this and I have actually
started a medusa client (which is a python-based persistent web 
server library). This would be 
persistent on the backend - not the front 
end.","2002-10-04","50"

well, actually, there are browser-based 
python extensions - just like JS - but that's not what I was referring
to. Charles said that he and Daniel 
were just wondering about 
python-plugin. But I still think
writing majority of the client in ECMAscript would be best. then use 
PSP, ASP, C, Perl, PHP, or whatever for 2-tier backend 
connectivity. Jason felt that without 
a persistent backend, that'll be a bitch - as you'll have to 
load/reload forms - and data sets. Daniel also felt that
then you end up implementing a lot 
of GNUe Common's functionality again. Charles said 
its mainly just db routines,
AFAIK.. Daniel disagreed - common 
is more than just the db - it is basically our framework - xml
parsers, db, rpc, config file parsing, Gobj tree, triggers,
etc. base classes for implementing client and server programs too

that xforms/xul stuff is web form 
based - our stuff is data driven from the core i.e. gnue forms

Andrew felt that the community can't 
really do that, since any specific choice would not meet 
everyone's needs -
who knows, GNUe might become the 
standard amongst GNU projects. For him, the issue was
not so much choosing a default 
appserver, but a set of common standards that an appserver must 
adhere to. He noted just
because the appserver is in python, doesn't mean that code it 
runs will need to be :) - the goal is to be able to

it's the highly modified code originally based upon

because it's common to our code - 
theoretically, other GNUe tools such as Reports or Navigator might want to 
use it. James explained there isn't a curses library 
out there at the moment that does what we require or that is maintained - 
we had this on seperate cvs server out of main code base -

not sure how feature complete it is compared to the wxgtk driver

opportunity to test it, so I can't say whether ""far along"" means 
""usable"" or not. We almost have a curses version too -

Jason Cater (jcater) said the reports 
package is not nearly far along as the forms package - 
it's only at 0.0.2 - so it isn't spitting out reports for 
production use yet. But his intention was that it should 
be able to talk to the printer natively
i.e., send actual text - not pictures of the pages. 
He noted that many Windows-based report programs 
use truetype fonts, etc, then render 
graphics to send to the printers - that has its place of course
- and you could do that if you wanted - but that's just doing 
injustice to dot-matrix printers :). James Thompson 
(jamest) said i would think it'd be 
as hard on the printer as you'd like - as you could have your own 
output filter - what little I've gotten into it i would think you 
could do dump text w/o too much issue. He thought that 
reports is pretty cool - thanks to 
jcater's mad coding skills he hacked a fax spammer filter up for 
me - so we could send reports to various schools. 1 year ago this

well, the gnue-forms executable launches

the current  both propietrary and GPL apps that GNUe aims to 
rival? Derek Neighbors (derek) said that, for the GNUe 
Tools, currently forms is almost feature 
complete to Oracle SQL*Forms product and it 
can replace Access (for applications 
*not query building*). Reporter has no equals that i can tell 
(reportlabs (free software) might be the closest) - but even BIG 
vendors like crystal reports and business objects dont really have 
a 'server' with caching and transformation like we do. Designer is 
similar to filemaker pro, delphi, powerbuilder or visual basic (only 
specific for business applications). App server would be similar to 
any app server on the market only with additional features 
specifically geared to writing business/enterprise applications. 
On the Packages, dcl is similar to MANY 
free software applications like request tracker and such - as similar 
to commercial applications like support magic or the likes. acclite 
would be similar to netledger, sql*ledger etc. The backend stuff is 
like nothing comparable in free software world that i know of and 
only the BIG end has it in the proprietary end - by backend i mean 
shipping automation, warehouse management, order management etc etc 
etc. Keith said So you have a well 
defined roadmap. Derek disagreed, saying that 
a well defined roadmap was 
next on the list - after the 0.4.0 
release. He felt that having in 
head and having official roadmap are two different things - 
most of the core team has an idea of what the road map is - just 
some finer points arent ironed out and none of it is official down 
digitally for others to review.","2002-10-11","51"

it depends on your perspective :) - 
in any case, the GNUe Forms version would 
not be dependent on the PHP version - nor vice versa - although

NZ as well. He wondered why Andrew was 
creating a new project rather than working 
on top of acclite? Andrew felt 
acclite seems to do a bit too much for a 
small business. Nicholas agreed it could be confusing. 
However if you design your UI over the top 
to hide the 'unneeded' features, you get the later bonus of tracking 
acclites development and being able to upgrade to a 'large' application 
easier. Andrew agreed, but 
currently acclite is mostly php-only - not the best thing to try & 
put forms onto for standalone apps - since FTBA will need to run on 
mostly windows desktops, without a webserver to run the php. 
Nicholas said from my understanding they are 
working towards form's version of acclite. Andrew noted 
but that requires taking the php code 
& turning it into something forms-accessible :) - which is a rather 
large task. Nicholas said actally I

wiki 
page he had done for Axis groupware about the options for

i see that you're still focussing on the 
web-based - would you be using a php GNUe forms client, for example? 
as phpforms seems to be the main web forms client at the moment. 
Dan said we focus on the web based, where that 
means having a relatively thin, platform independant, client.  
preferably launchable via a web browser for reasons of authentication and 
UI integration. ""Web based"" may also mean that it's relatively tolerant 
of imperfections in the connection, i.e. run via internet. I think i 
have the same definition of ""web based"" as derek does, and it 
has no tie to html although it's highly preferable - but man if it 
makes the app seriously suffer, like for rapid data entry or 
needing a stateful connection, then that's something else - 
i mean it may require a thicker client than html.","2002-10-15","51"
"1680","723","2","Andrew said his definition of web-based was 
accessible via the internet, usually 
via HTTP (including layers like XML-RPC or SOAP) - the standard GNUe 
forms client can load forms via http, and talk to the appserver via 
xml-rpc - it seriously rocks, really :) Dan agreed - 
yeah that might imply the possibility for ssl
- and it could be launched via a browser. People need to have a single 
environment to branch off of, that being the intranet, and being 
powered by what we call groupware. That should be an application 
launching zone if not literally the all-encompassing appserver 
itself. Andrew said that the new GEAR (GNUe Archive) 
format could do something like this. Dan said that the browser 
should be the encompassing GUI, that is - 
like the master menu - that's how to cater toward being the most 
things to the most people - having good defaults - making sure 
people know about system updates - having a groupware launchpad 
being the default home page. Andrew said 
like an html-based GNUe 
Navigator? GNUe Navigator is currently a basic forms & 
reports client, which has a menu/tree Nicholas Lee (esands)

build the infrastructure so that applications can tie together 
nicely. Andrew said that's 
the aim of GNUe, DotGNU, and AxisGW - being 'glueware'. 
Nicholas agreed - common meme.","2002-10-15","51"
"1681","723","3","Andrew said what would be interesting 
would be if GNUe's appserver could run a caching php 
interpreter. Nicholas confirmed that mod_php reinterprets 
a page on each hit Unless you use something 
commerical. Andrew said that's 
one thing that webware & GNUe's appserver won't do with python - 
they store the interpreted objects in memory. 
Nicholas said WHy not use a 
python web enviroment instead? Quixote? 
Andrew suggested because GNUe's 
appserver could do some of that stuff anyway?. 
Nicholas noted that Zend sells a php 
cache. Andrew was familiar 
with webware, haven't heard of quixote. Nicholas said that 
lwn run 
it. Andrew was surprised that 
there isn't a free php cache - i guess the interpreter works well 
enough for quite a few - or those that need the cache have enough 
incentive to pay for one :) Dan said 
there are free php caches - one comes with 
the latest mod_php - also see lingerd. Andrew said 
it sounded like lingerd wasn't a php 
cache, but an app to avoid keeping sockets open too long. 
Dan confirmed this - so for some dynamic 
sites you can use php cache and lingerd together to 
maximise performance. Andrew agreed - fast, 
scalable - so long as the php code itself is written nicely ;) - 
/me is perfectly able to write some really bad & non-scalable

point but misleading marketing is 
not a good thing... it usually backfires and will destroy a ""brand""

dont think we should market packages that dont exist in that fashion

sure we arent talking in future tense that suggests some day we might 
consider it, but rather in a language that  says we ARE making

My big frustration today is that folks 
think GNUe has no deliverables. Jason felt this was a 
consequence of the general focus in project literature on the 
(mostly still in planning) packages rather than the (mostly existing

in line with jcaters assement perhaps we need to market as two projects

have 100 people out and about. Do they each need to cert? 
Jason said usually you file this ""Certificate 
of Resale"" with the vendor so they have it on file - and this only 
applies to stuff you resale - if you are consuming within your business
you still have to pay sales tax. Charles clarified

that? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said Navigator produced
a tree of forms and reports with

time, with an hour's work I now can run a 
business in NZ with sql-ledger.. Having spent half a day with 
acclite/nola I realised I'd have to hack the 
nola/acclite scheme to deal with the fact its US-centric and doesn't 
report GST (sales tax) on purchases. Thus, regardless of the code base, 
for me sql-ledger is usable and nola/acclite is not. sql-ledger still 
has some things I'd like to have, 8) but its functional. It deals with 
FX gain/loss in a nice manner, plus it has a system which works for NZ 
GST. The two main things I need at the moment.. Also, 
sql-ledger had a much smaller schema than nola - 
nola's got moore features, but in most cases 
you dont need it. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) agreed -

to accounting systems - they want something that's proven to work well

might work, but not being able to reconcile an account is well not good

there is less of it - but that doesnt make it 'a better schema' 
imho. Nicholas said that might be 
true, but sql-ledger gets me where I want to go today.  Nola would 
require a new schema to sort out the lack of GST/sales-tax tracking 
for vendors.  SL does have some issues with its schema, I suspect it 
needs to normalise a little bit. Still working today is better than 
working tomorrow with something better.  Esp if it saves me having to 
running MYOB under win4lin and I can wait for gnue to get to a better

it does'nt work - the ""field"" attribute is completely ignored - this is 
because xls's translate it to insert into table xxx values(

The next day, Ariel confirmed that he had 
tried to correct the xsl's to produce 
""insert into sometable (...) values (...) - the problem is that, 
then the ""field"" attribute must be REQUIRED - otherwise you can 
have a mix of <row>s both with and without ""field"" atrribute - 
that is sintactically correct but meaningless. Another solution 
(but seems me cumbersome) is to have two kinds of <row>

<row> </row> can only have <value>'s without 
field attribute and in exact number and order as in the table 
declaraion.
<namedrow>..</namedrow> that must have 
<value field=""foo"">bar</value> elements


In any case, since the corrisponding 
table declaration can be in another file, it is beyond xml/xls 
capability to check that the <row>'s are in the right number 
and order, and there could also be type mismatches 
(character data into numeric fields, etc.). Jan agreed - 
we need to differentiate between row

purpose app server - /methinks all app servers have a purpose or focus,

:). Keith said I mean, giving that 
GNUe emphasizes in being developed towards business, I wonder what does 
it imply - What features include and what are excluded, compared to other 
ones. Jason pointed to 
,

centralization of business rules [or logic] coupled with database

geas was our original implementation of 
an application server -it was contributed by a company in nz. However it 
turned out that it didn't fit too well into the overall concept of GNUe
so we decided to restart from scratch - and to not mix up the ""old"" one 
and the ""new"" one, we agreed to call the new one ""appserver"" instead of 
""geas"" - so most documentation that refers to ""geas"" probably is obsolete 
as it refers to a no-longer-used-piece-of-code - or it refers to the new 
appserver but was written before that renaming decision was made 
:) Keith felt it is better to use a name
instead of the general term ""application server"". Nick Rusnov 
(nickr) suggested an Appserver called 
Gary, but Jason said I like Bob.

suggested other alternative names and acronyms.","2002-10-20","52"

, 
Derek Neighbors (derek) asked anyone 
know status of our html driver ? Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) 
said it seems.... everything can be 
written in javascript (except backend db routines).. and it may be 
beneficial (but license problematic) to create a mozilla/netscape 
version and IE version within the same script code ie. XUL for 
mozilla and JScript/?? for IE. the javascript is in 
jans 
dir... IIRC. Derek asked why 
problematic? there is a free javascript implementation 
iirc - and there is no license issue - it is only a moral 
issue - i.e. i would think it poor form in someways to spend time 
on an implementation that 
requires a non free parser - but certainly one could do it without 
license issues - as long as the 
source is GPL or free software it could be part of GNUe officially, 
but i would lean towards not including as 'official' gnue if it 
required non free software to run. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) pointed out that the Mozilla implementation of 
javascript was avilable under the GPL 
in their dual licensing scheme. Derek agreed, but noted 
that Microsoft Internet Explorer was definantly not - this was why 
he would prefer if you make a 
xplatform javascript app thats cool - its only if you make it so 
it CANT run on non freesoft that would be an issue. 
For example, the main GNUe Forms client used wxWindows, which 
worked on many different platorms, including Microsoft Windows - 
but it doesnt MANDATE windows.
He would even supoprt a native w32 
port of forms client (even though it requires non-free software) - 
only because we have more functional clients that run on free 
platforms. I would say the same for javascript as well as long 
as we have free equivalents in place - 
but i think the free ones should 
take priority.","2002-10-20","52"

coding madman.. completely blows me away, but I think its 
possible to write such an app. Daniel Baumann

a JS application still be Free if licensed under the GPL even 
if it ran on a prop. implementation? In any case, 
we have a Free implmentation and 
Ecma standards. Charles was not sure 
that ECMAScript was as fully funtional as either 
Netscape/Mozilla's Javascript or Microsoft's JScript. 
Derek said this was not the point - 
if i write an application that 
is GPL that uses visual basic - well thats kind of stupid for 
GNU to support. Certainly my application is free software - 
but if requiring NON FREE software to 'modify' it is a 
requirement - it kind of defeats the purpose of making it free 
software in the first place :) btw: this has long been my gripe

"1707","739","1","It was asked why GNUe used python rather than scheme/guile for its 
scripting language. Christian Selig (lupo) said that 
gnue is meant to be language neutral 
when it comes to program applications with it, but there are AFAIK 
no hooks for other languages than python yet - this was 
just because nobody has shown interest 
for that yet. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said 
our main reason to choose python 
as our main scripting language - is that gnue should be usable and 
extendable by business people - and scheme is not a language that 
typical business people tend to understand :) Christian 
agreed - most ERP programmers don't 
want to ""program"", they just want some simple coding facility for 
their purposes - gnue is coded in python because it's easy to 
learn and understand and because it is as good as java (as a 
programming language), but better than java (as a platform / reg. 
licensing). It was noted that Designer would be a key part 
of the framework in reducing the amount of ""programming"" needed. 
Christian agreed - ""programming"" 
implies (for me) a deep understand of the entire structure, 
""coding"" a well-placed hack to solve a specific 
problem.","2002-10-21","52"

out, I'll can probably contrib a few end-user apps I need for 
my own use.  Derek Neighbors (RevDeke) said

client Jason Cater (jcater) said 
certainly, a dummy-style popup search

Querying from a form then having to 
step though each form to find the right one, just isn't nice.

list screen.","2002-10-21","52"
"1710","740","2","Derek said there are two things 
we need - 1. is the lookup / search box - 2. is what he is

this, where you see a list of the 
items via a grid - you troll around find the one you want - 
and click a 'detail' button - then you get full contents of that 
record in a single form. So maybe your grid has product number ; 
product desc; qty on hand; qty on order; or such - you find the 
one you want and click it - and poof you get FULL detail.
Jason said if you are wanting the equiv 
of the panes - we do that - and do it well - it's called 
master/detail blocks. Derek agreed - 
this might be doable with tabs
- think 'hidable' panes - i.e. one pane with grid one in normal 
mode. In a nutshell the 
functionality is there - maybe just not 'exactly' how you want 
it visually - but getting a list and selecting an item to get 
its detail works today - just you must use two panes -

Python triggers have full access to your installed Python modules.

at version 10.0 - compared to other opensource (sic) stuff we are 
probably somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0 - it all depends.

good about version numbering and so i think 0.4.0 is realistic if you

with lots of players - i suspect someone will have to compile the 
TODOs of the tools and such - and make a draft roadmap and solicit 
feedback - and modify the feedback into the roadmaps, rinse and 
repeat a few times - and there is something go by. The other issue 
is getting a road map might not be too bad for the 'next' release 
but a good roadmap will include 2 to 3 releases out.","2002-10-23","53"
"1729","748","4","Keith, reprising 
, 
asked what about setting up a 
Wiki? Derek said i think wiki 
is good for user driven content that needs minimal controls -
but official documentation, guides, roadmaps and such - that need 
tighter review and control are not good for wiki IMHO. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) noted most wikis 
these days allow you to have at least access control. 
Peter said we already have 10 
channels of communication such as mailing lists and IRC 
- /me would support a wiki if it 
replaced some of those - rather than just became number 
11.","2002-10-23","53"
"1730","748","5","Keith said I favor a webforum for 
instance, instead of a mailing list. (but thats is just my 
opinion). Peter said we 
tried that for about a year - I was responsible for killing it
as no-one was using it. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) 
said that was not exatly the same 
thing - PHPNuke is like a news site - PHPBB or something 
similar would be a forum. Peter said 
the real focus of this project 
for good or ill is IRC - mostly for good, IMHO. 
Daniel agreed - we have IRC so 
this is our support system ;). Keith felt that 
as the user base or contributors grow, 
a forum is better suited than a mailing list. 
Derek said webforums suck for 
developers - i have no problem people making what works best 
for them - but dont expect developers (those most capable of 
helping) to spread accross 15 different mediums. 
Nick Rusnov (nickr) felt that mailing 
lists are great because they are easy to ignore - it takes no 
effort. Keith said not for 
developers then. but for discussions on features an such.
and roadmaps. Web forums were 
easier to browse than a mailing lists 
archive. James Thompson (jamest) said 
we did forums, long long ago at 
peoples insistance (is that a word? :) - anyway, we set them 
up and they got used exactly ZERO times - kinda ticked me off 
to be honest :) Peter suggested 
the best way is to hard-wire our 
brains together in a neural net - then we'd all finally 
understand chillywilly. James said 
no way I want to know what goes 
on in chillywilly's brain man - i barely can keep track of 
the voices in my head let alone his.","2002-10-23","53"

Nicholas Lee (esands) asked Anyone suggest a 
good data modeller? There doesn't seem to much free stuff. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested dia 
;). Nicholas said this doesn't generate 
sql though.  I just managed to get 
pgdesigner 
compiled. Simple but looks useful He had also looked at 
http://www.alzabo.org/ 
(perl nightmare to install, needs mason). Charles Rouzer 
(Mr_You) wondered if you could build that 
into GNUe. maybe one day ;-) maybe GNUe Designer could have ""New->Form"" 
and ""New->Schema"" or somethin. Nicholas said 
I guess someone could - pgdesigner is in 
c++ - Problem is with SQL is that different DBs have different 
requirements. Charles said well, 
I guess it would only be useful for designer. unless you wanted to be 
able to create tables from a Form. Nicholas was concerned 
about the security implications of this. Charles said 
well.. to create/edit Forms it requires 
you have some sort of ability to build a database table.. as things 
get complicated a schema designer is a good addition to Form 
building. it would fit right in with Designer. right now I think it 
reads schemas - actually I 
guess it just reads individual tables. I believe the wizard will 
query your datasource (db table) and help build a form.
Nicholas said I guess in that sense, 
doesn't help you put together then schema though. 
Charles agreed - the schema would mean 
multiple tables.. so now we have another wish list item 
;-). Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said 
there's multi-datasource in the works 
already - he had seen some commits to CVS about this.","2002-10-23","53"

Some days later, 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) asked does 
designer do db schemas yet? Jason Cater (jcater) said 
not well - it still has a ways to 
go. Nicholas Lee (esands) said 
supposely with some xsl and dia you can.  
pgdesigner can do the job as well. Daniel said

a Segmentation fault with gnue-forms - Splash screen comes up; then 
font chooser; then segv - gnue-designer is fine. 
Jason Cater (jacter) asked can you try 
running with the -s option, and seeing if it still segfaults?. 
Lawrence confirmed looks like -s option did the 
trick! Jason said you probably 
want to modify your gnue.conf file with:
[forms]
disableSplash = 1
- then you won't have to use the -s option all the time. 
He added we are having some issues 
with timeouts on our splash screen - it rears it's ugly head on 
slower machines. I guess we either need to find a solution, or 
disable the splashscreen by default :( He explained
the problem is, if the splashscreen 
tries to disappear before the main screen is completely drawn
it segfaults. We can increase the timer more - but that's 
avoiding the problem, not fixing it :) Lawrence said 
slow machine? 1.4 athalon with 
a gig of memory not fast enough? Jason said

this problem on any thing faster than a 266Mhz.","2002-10-24","53"
"1734","751","1","Bajusz Tamás (btami) pasted some code he had added to 
his sitecustomize.py 
file to avoid having to set 
different encodings. Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) asked 
if this meant offering final user 
to modify his/her sitecustomize.py to enable GNUe work with 
his/her encoding? Bajusz said 
no and yes :) - i imagine that 
setup process puts sitecustomize.py into some right 
place normally, rather than the user setting it every 
time. Arturas noted that one 
linux guru noticed, that forcing users to modify 
sutecustomize.py is no good for several reasons - the most 
simpliest case would be some other software that needs current 
sitecustomize and it can't work with other sitecustomize and 
GNUe, that can't work with current sitecustomize - it's good 
for us as developers - it's good for some users - but we can't 
enforce this - and we should be able to support encodings as 
well as possible with current sitecustomize.py. 
Bajusz said maybe we can offer 
this if there isn't any sitecustomize.py existing 
already. Arturas said [i _think_ 
(i don't know this for sure) that installing python installs 
sitecustomize.py] automatically. Bajusz said 
in win32 and python 2.1 2.2 the 
file doesn't exist per default - and i think forcing enduser to 
make this file then write somethong into it was not very 
user-friendly - plus he have to 
know what is your encoding name. Arturas said 
the idea is pretty good
but at the moment, his priority was getting a

don't you? but Nick thought it was something more 
serious - I don't think that error would 
occur if there were missing dependencies. Later, the 
solution was uncovered. A previous version of GNUe, installed

on the system - removing this first solved the problem.","2002-10-24","53"

the realtime updating of dropdown 
boxes, as discussed previously in

He explained what i have is a case 
of product categories that can have parents - the parents are 
in combo boxes - so if i add a new one - then add a second and 
want what i added as the first to be a parent, i have 
to shut the form down and restart it to get it to show in the 
dropdown. He would not object if the solution involved
doing it via triggers.
Jason Cater (jcater) said I'm adding a 
resetForeignKey, but do note that you are programming for 
specific UI features if using a combo that way.","2002-10-24","53"
"1737","753","2","Later, Jan Ischebeck (siesel) said 
I've tried to build a testcase for 
that resetForeignKey() statement, but there are some issues, 
which need to change a bit of code in common - 
its the parameter stuff which made 
me changing stuff. i've made a form with two dropdowns. The 
user can choose a state in the first, and should choose a city 
in the next and will get displayed the zipcode in an style=label 
entry. The second dropdown is using a parameter in a condition 
to display just the cities from the state chosen in the first 
dropdown. So I added a setParameter function. But that didn't 
work because of caching parameters values in the cparam class 
and because of the dbsig dbdriver replacing the staticCondidition 
by a preparsed string :( - which is also the reason of passing 
a parameter in the command line is not working at the 
moment. Jason said hmm - 
I had intended on runtime parameters to be read only - /me is 
trying to think through your example. He said 
I guess they don't have to be - 
I suppose we can add a setParameter and get rid of the caching 
code. Jan said other 
possibilities would be to have a 'populateForeignKey' or a 
'add/change staticConditions'. Jason doubted that 
the caching code speeded things 
up much anyway.","2002-10-24","53"
"1738","753","3","Jan pointed to the problem line of code he wanted to change - 
This will change the GObj tree.
Jason wondered should we NOT modify the 
GObj tree in _dbsig - but still create the static condition - 
but add an invalidateCachedConditions() method. He 
explained it recursively changes stuff 
until you are left with a single string - so that it only has to 
do that once - in the end, 
there's only one node. This meant that 
there's not a clean solution to 
adding support for changable runtime 
parameters.","2002-10-24","53"
"1739","753","4","Jan said the other possibility 
would be to change the staticConditions using a trigger. 
Jason said so you are thinking we could 
add a setCondition(<GCondition tree>) method to GDataSource?
or something like that? Jan agreed - 
its just a bit OVERKILL for just 
changing a parameter - I mean, I would like to have both 
possibilities. Jason agreed, but 
what you are describing is not
the typical use of a parameter - 
although I'm not opposed to having a setParameter - 
as long as we don't add much more overhead to 
datasources. He gave a specific example - 
I have one report using GNUe Reports 
right now that's a master/detail report - there's approx 1,800 
records in the master datasource - so that's 1,800 times the 
child datasource is run - and 
I have much more complex reports to 
do.","2002-10-24","53"
"1740","753","5","Jan said my actual patch to have 
parameter working is just to NOT cache the static part of the 
parameters - If reports is getting too slow we still can add 
caching, and probably in a better way :) Jason said 
so, the plans are to add a 
DataSource.setCondition() and a Form.setParameter() and remove 
parameter caching? We can see how that works. I may be worried 
about nothing :) - but you do understand my worry about reports, 
right? Jan said I fully 
understand. And I finally know why you add that caching line to 
parameters.","2002-10-24","53"

Some days later, Jason said he was
almost ready for a 0.4.1 release of 
stuff. Derek asked did 
we come up with a way to update lu comboboxes? we had 
discussed using triggers or the likes. Jason said 
it's not fully tested - but we 
have an Entry.resetForeignKey(). Derek said he had 
a form he wanted to test it with - 
and if it works for me you 
can probably put in 0.4.1 ;). Jason 
asked how does this form work?
as that determines where you'd put it. Derek said 
the table had id, description, 
parent but some ids were also parents - 
basically the category table is a 
foreign key to its self. Jason said 
we can do this - BUT any new ""childs"" 
will need to be committed to the database before we can get 
the dropdown to update. Derek agreed - 
i was going to put the resetFK
in the postcommit trigger.","2002-10-24","53"

good though - you now have the form the way it needs to be - 
it's just we have to get forms client

yes i believe it does. 
Lawrence said the scott tiger sample database used by Oracle

scott/tiger is a good start - that's 
one thing I liked about Oracle's books - every one of their

based on the scott/tiger db - I'd like to see us do something 
similar. Lawrence said I'll 
work on one - does any one have suggestions? Jason said 
well, if possible, it shouldn't be

be able to merge properly. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked

both?. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
mostly clients, depends on the form - 
not sure how well appserver does triggers at the moment, would 
have to ask siesel or reinhard. Charles noted that 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) had said that the 
important trigger/business logic/consitence checking etc. should
be done in appserver, in case of javascript AND python 
clients. Andrew agreed - so 
that'd be remote triggers in appserver - there might be some stub 
code for calling that within the forms - i am not certain - just 
requires a simple xml-rpc call, i guess. However, 
it depends on the forms - most forms 
now have inline python triggers - but hopefully they'll move away 
from that. Charles said that the 
best route for the javascript client will be XMLRPC only.","2002-10-26","53"
"1756","758","2","Jason Cater (jcater) said that's going to 
be sooo damn much overhead - having remote-only triggers - can you 
imagine the communications between client and server for every 
single keystroke, etc. Charles said 
X has high overhead  but people still 
use it ;-). Jason said that, where an X server was 
shared among many clients, it was normal to have multiple/back-up
servers to avoid a SINGLE point of 
failure. Charles asked so how 
do you propose high avaibility appserver?  ;-) Jason said 
why do you assume I'd ever use appserver?
I think it's great people are wanting it and writing it - 
but that doesn't translate into me ever using it. 
Using an application server simply added another point of failure 
to the system. The same argument could in extremis be applied to 
the database server as well, but database servers added more value 
and there were hardware and software solutions for high-availablity 
of database servers already. He went the 
route of having middleware and my High Availability (HA) 
went <poop> :). 
He was not thrilled about GNUe requiring 
an appserver for all the accounting stuff - not thrilled at all
but that's not my call. Charles said 
ahh well you just use triggers for 
business logic? Jason felt this was part of what triggers 
were for in the first place. Charles said that 
appserver could provide HA capabilities 
at some point, but that was not the point - high-availability 
is expensive and not normally available 
to small biz, so avoiding Application Server to maintain 
HA was unnecessary. Jason said for a small 
business, you are adding yet one more layer that can, and at some 
point will, go wrong - /me works for a small biz - it's a statistics 
game - the more layers you add that can go down, the more often you 
go down. In my mind - until you have multiple database servers - 
something like an application server isn't gaining you anyhing
but rather costing you. He felt that the 
current trend toward middleware 
was not looking at historical evidence
and case studies. For some, middleware makes sense. But I see more 
times than not these days, ""if it's not N-tier, how on earth am I 
supposed to use it"" - Enterprises were successfully doing 2-tier 
(and even 1-tier) long before n-tier.","2002-10-26","53"

appserver should only have

not necessarily methods/triggers for the appserver - as I agree 
with jcater you don't want frelling rpc calls for every little ui 
interaction. then again how 
often does a form hit the db? not on every single trigger does 
it? I don't think it works that way....","2002-10-26","53"

to function. Jan asked which earlier versions of 
GNUe Forms had supported python 1.5 - 
so the switch to 2.0 was short 
before gnue forms 0.3.0, I think.","2002-10-27","53"
"1760","760","2","Derek Neighbors (revDeke) asked Jan why he was 
restricted to Windows CE 2.2. Jan said 
I have no money for a new PDA 
:(. Derek thinks 
perhaps you need to flash it and install something new on 
it :) He explained gnue 
should be focused on architectures to where its going more 
than where it is - that was a large part of the python 2.x 
decision. We figured by the time GNUe 1.0 ships - 2.x will 
be OLD - and 1.5.2 probably about unsupported. 
Jan said if I get forms 0.1.0 
working, its ok. The main aim is to present a working gnue 
on a PDA to a customer. If I get the project, they can use 
a Linux PDA. i.e. no porting needed. Derek said 
python should work no problem
- but we will likely need another UI client - qtopia more 
than likely - or something similar. He would 
recommend going to 
#handhelds.org and seeing if anyone there has any tips/hints 
suggestions to getting linux in some form working 
on Jan's existing PDA - this might be easier than 
re-writing GNUe. Also, what 
about curses version of gnue? give another 3 months and we 
can probably proof it on an iPAQ for you.","2002-10-27","53"
"1761","760","3","Derek discovered that 
familiarOS for iPAQ has
Integrated Python v2.0 w/ PyGtk and PyGDKImlib. - 
time to test out that gnue pygtk driver :)
Jason pointed out that the GNUe UI driver was for 
GTK2, not GTK, but Jan said it 
can be easily modified to work with GTK. - but Its 
possibly better to just install debian unstable on the 
iPAQ. Jason agreed - 
otherwise, how else do you get 
frozenbubbles easily? Derek noted that 
familiar provides 100% 
binary compatiablity to debian dpkg w/ ipkg - er the arm 
distribution - so in theroy if arm supports 
pygtk2.","2002-10-27","53"
"1762","760","4","He was very enthusiastic about the prospect of getting 
designer to run on an ipaq - 
/me can see techie meetings.... no more need to fall alseep 
one can design forms while in meetings, literally can have 
things DONE before you leave a meeting :) - instead of 
saying... ""that would only take five minutes"" and end 
of meeting give it to them and say ""that only took 5 
minutes"" ;). Jason asked about the screen 
resolution, and cringes at the 
thought of designing w/in 320x200 :). Derek 
said if you used 'virtual 
desktops' and a tabbed windows manager (like fluxbox) - 
it might be doable if you were designing forms for the 
iPAQ.","2002-10-27","53"

really bad about it - stating they are only 200 thats cheap 
enough to 'buy'. i kept stating this is for FREE not 
PROPRIETARY software - and that likely more FREE software 
would only HELP Zaurus sales not HURT them - but the marketing 
drones i had to deal with basically were clueless :( 
HP/COMPAQ on the other hand is much more savvy - 
and understands the concept of symbiotic relationships - 
which is most odd as it should really be reversed seeing 
how zaurus is the linux pda and ipaq the pocketpc one....

you checked out erp5.org?
Derek Neighbors (derek) said it is what 
i had hoped the gnue.org community site could be like. He 
explained at one time i wanted to do 
somethign similar to erp5 - as it was needed - and we caught major 
crap for posting non gnue stuff - and it was confusing - it really 
needed to be a separate site. This was 
our old phpnuke site for gnue.org - 
i had hoped to do more an ERP community tyep of thing - but we 
needed to make it a second site - as to not confuse people -

technical approach? Derek said 
i only saw it as an erp portal -

is one of the things gnue was supposed to do - compile stuff 
together in a sense - but i digress. He 
didnt see that they were actively 
'coding' anything - but rather consolidating/packaging existing

"1766","762","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) asked where 
to put packages :) for gnue. He had to get some work for a 
client started asap - i have the stuff 
in private cvs - i would like to address what to do with that stuff
- as well as get mroe information on gear stuff. He wanted 
to spend minimal time talking (yeah 
amazing eh) and roll up sleeves and get a hacking - but im to point 
i need good place to put this stuff as im going to encourage others 
to contribute ASAP. acclite fits in that mix as well - a little 
clean up and really i think the base of 'stuff' is done -
i.e. product categories and product maintenance - which is the start 
of ordering/inventory/invoicing etc - i.e. partnumbers woot!. 
He was going to consider revamping the 
module writers guide or such - and start creating two tier module 
docs - and merging in louis accounting stuff and comparing to nola 
and such - /me is gung ho - ready for some public announcements and 
website updates and code committing. His main question was 
mainly where to put the work. 
Jason said I'd like to see this be the 
start of using separate modules - i.e., I'd like to see 
gnue-accounting - (or whatever you want to call it)","2002-10-27","53"
"1767","762","2","Derek said long term i want to know 
where we put on website (as discussed) - and package management.
i would like to see this be the start of packages on the website
i.e. official packages so to speak. I am down with modules but it 
gets shaky on data dictionaries - as if i make say CRM and Inovicing
- both use the contact database - so where do i put contact data 
dictionary stuff? If i put in crm then invoicing now depends on crm
- /me doesnt expect easy answer here or a instant solution as i 
think its MUCH more complicated than that. Jason said 
um - just put it somewhere - we'll move 
it around later :) Derek agreed - 
i wouldnt be opposed to saying X depends 
on Y for NOW - as having usable stuff will make folks so happy it 
shouldnt matter much - as long as we have an eye for a better solution 
long term. i also considered putting data dictionary all in one place
and loading all tables regardless of what you install - 
but then you only have to get the forms, reports etc of what you 
want. Jason agreed.","2002-10-27","53"
"1768","762","3","Jason asked what is the official stance 
on what you're doing? these are stepping stone packages? thesse 
are unofficial, but working solutions?. Derek said he did 
not mind - you know what i have to make
- about 3 or 4 folks are wanting identical thing - whether we make 
this an unofficial soslution using the framework and put in speical 
cvs and special website - or whether we put on gnue as official 
'starter' packages to be replaced later - or whether we say these 
are official packages that will grow over time - makes no difference 
to me. I just want to be able to advertise to solict 'help'.
He thought making them officially gnue 
likely will help gnue's image - look at our website, its apparent we 
want to offer working systems :). Jason had no strong views
either, but for political reasons, it may 
be best to have this as an unofficial solution using the framework - 
it's a tricky situation :) I can tell you now, it'll be ""damned if 
you do, damned if you don't"" - so choose your poison now and move 
on.","2002-10-27","53"
"1769","762","4","Jason would probably lean towards ""usable, 
but not quite official"" solution in a separate cvs (but on 
savannah) (the FSF's 
free software alternative to sourceforge) but 
still advertise on our website. Derek wondered 
why not just use existing 
CVS on GNUe's own server where we have 
acclite and/or UE stuff as of time of writing. Jason said 
he would like to see anon cvs 
but neither jamest or I are ready to open 
up GNUe's own server like that 
:). Derek remembered thats 
right no pserver there - ok i will start a project then on savannah
- make a little web page and such. Jason said 
I would name it gnue-????? and put on gnue 
website - just be careful with wording :) - so it's ""associated 
with"" GNue even if not in our main cvs repos.","2002-10-27","53"
"1770","762","5","
After midnight, Peter Sullivan (psu) said
I would still rather we 
did the back-office stuff packages + acclite rewrite
as ""real"" GNUe packages if at all possible - even if 
0.0.1 or 0.1.0 versions from 
a webmaster/PR point of 
view. He felt people 
would rather have packages that meet someone's need - 
and can be used as a basis for something more general - 
than get stuck in Proposal Hell for another 12-18 
months - if the problem was 
just the need to be seen 
to follow the proposal process - I would say change 
the process. Nicholas Lee (esands) asked 
WHat is the actually plan for 
acclite at the moment?  Current having hacked around 
the code somewhat it just seems to be a modified 
version of nola to work _somewhat_ with postgresql.  
Is someone working on forms for it? 
Peter said I believe that 
a couple of screens have been converted to GNUe Forms
- but that it has been a bit on back burner 
until now.","2002-10-27","53"
"1771","762","6","Later on, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo_) asked whether the 
new CVS for GNUe Applications had been set up on savannah 
yet. He explained we have some 
'small biz' stuff getting ramped up and ready - there was 
concern about putting in place of 'official' gnue packaging
- and we definitely didnt want in the gnue tools cvs. 
He said i have product management 
basics ready - and contact management stuff is nearly ready - 
those two things are the BASE for ordering/invoicing/inventory 
and the likes - as you have to have product and customers 
:) Nicholas Lee (esands) said 
Hopefully when I get this 
Foreign Exchange (FX) management 
stuff sort, its something you might put in there. 
Derek said i also plan serious 
ramp up and extension of pieces of acclite. Nicholas 
asked What is the roadmap for 
acclite?  You going to work with the php base at all? Or 
develop the form/gnue side of things? Derek said 
originally i had planned on 
keeping the php side up - but more i look at it its likely 
i will not - but others could - /me suspects it will depend 
on how much we start modifying the underlying structures - 
if its minor tweaks there are reasons to keep the php up
if its more major or new stuff its probably not worth the 
core's time. Nicholas asked if 
the schema is worth using. Derek said 
if the schema isnt worth using 
we will modify as necessary. Nicholas said 
Main thing I'd need fix in order 
to use it, is sales tax on the vendors side. 
Derek said i already have own 
product structure and own contact structure - /me has not 
compared how that looks to acclite - at first gander i suspect 
(hope) to rip Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable 
and General Ledger from acclite
- likely might not use anything else. Nicholas 
wonders if its worth using the nola 
base at all, or starting for scratch. Derek said 
looks like it has some docmanagement 
stuff - but the ui of forms might not be good for that. 
Nicholas said this was nothing to do 
with core accounting stuff though. Doesn't dcl handle some doc 
management stuff? I think though that doc management is an 
important part of contract/CR management. Derek said 
doc managment has about 10 different 
sdies - i think ulitmately we will need another 'tool' for this
- one that forms can interact with.","2002-10-27","53"
"1772","762","7","Derek emphasised that one of the 
pluses i saw in not doing official gnue is no hold ups - i.e. this 
isnt design by committee :) muhahaha - input definitely wanted - 
but things will be moving faster than making the right decision the 
first time :) When you get 300 people on a mailing list and design 
software - you get no where quick :) - as there are a million well 
if you do this you get X - and basically every sanctuary has its 
price - there is rarely a definitively right answer. 
Nicholas agreed - develop something that 
works for people. Either i) people will come and improve your work, 
ii) people will come see your work and have that flash and see 
how they can complete rewrite to to work for them and you - 
Either way its good for you and your got something working.
Derek agreed - just stating that the 
small biz stuff (because of outside requirements) will likely be 
very much do, refactor, do, refactor, do - we have 2 or 3 'customers' 
that are really driving the development - originally we were going 
to do in a more private cvs and wait until release to open cvs - 
but we feel that is not the free software way - we would rather let 
people play interactively - even if sometimes we have to say too 
bad as the needs of the paying customer had to take first 
priority. It was about baby steps - 
being able to catalog your products on a computer is better than 
not being able to even if you dont have inventory of them. 
so one might say products w/o inventory 
module is dumb - i say products is base for inventory so its progress 
:) He felt the two things i 
have seen 'drag down' projects  - a. bickering to decide on decisions 
for so long that you could have implemented in all proposed ways in 
the amount of time you spent arguing about it. - b. not starting 
anything until you have decided on EVERY possible feature and/or 
scenario. Nicholas said b) never 
works though. Prefection is impossible to get. Afterall who's prefection 
is it? Obviously its the person actually writing the code, thus 
you are back at some form of a) again.  Anyway it'll be good to see 
what you guys have got so far and what your roadmap is.  I can 
provide input on how that would work for the business enviroment
here in New Zealand.","2002-10-27","53"
"1773","762","8","Responding to Derek's original question, Jason Cater (jcater) 
said he had applied to the savannah-hackers mailing list to set up 
a new CVS, but had not heard back from them yet. He asked 
what's the typical turn-around to requests 
like mine? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
it's a project submission, so could be 
2 days if you're _really_ unlucky - usually a few hours, depends 
who's evaluating. Derek let off some steam that GNUe had had 
some problems with support requests from savannah and the FSF 
generally recently but added its really 
not fair to complain after all its volunteers - sometimes i think 
they could structure better though. ","2002-10-27","53"
"1774","763","1","Neatly linking together 
 and 
, 
Nicholas Lee (esands) said I don't 
really have the server spacem, but I can set a (t)wiki up 
easily enough. The question might be though, if erp5.org are 
doing it. Is it worth doing repeating?. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said if 
people really want a wiki, I would rather host it as 
wiki.gnuenterprise.org but 
At the moment, I would say
anything that people might want on a wiki e-mail it to 
him as I'm sure I can find a 
sensible place to slot it on the main web site.","2002-10-28","53"
"1775","763","2","Peter said The front page still 
concerns me - The ""What is GNUe?"" needs to be up front for 
newcomers - but for old hands, we really want the news to be 
first up. He wondered about using cookies to 
manipulate this, but Nicholas suggested 
Just have two different entry 
points - People bookmark the page they want. Otherwise the 
server is making decisions for the client.","2002-10-28","53"
"1776","763","3","Peter said The big issues on 
the website at the moment are - a) Docs need updating - I just 
need to get around to recompiling them from CVS - b) FAQ needs 
updating really badly - A lot of the material is already on the 
website - just needs folding back into FAQ. But then, as always, 
we accept patches ;-). Nicholas said 
wikis tend to make that process a 
little easier. (provision of patches). Peter said 
Actually, #1 priority is to get 
website into CVS so other people can touch site w/o 
having to let him know what they had done - he 
would pursue this further.","2002-10-28","53"
"1777","764","1","Bill Gribble (grib) asked can 
anybody here comment on the use of the designer and other 
tools with Guile?  are they totally tied to python or 
somewhat language neutral? James Thompson (jamest)
said right now they are tied 
to python - we have plans to support triggers in other 
languages - but no code exists yet to take advantage of 
it. Derek agreed that GNUe was 
tied to python - designer 
will likely always be unless there is a port (me sees 
little value in a port) - as to the forms client (forms 
is a spec, there already are php and javascript and java 
implemenations in cvs) ableit far from complete. i would 
say there is LITTLE need to make an implementation in a 
separate langaguage - as they are TOOLS not applications
i.e. we plan to support business logic in ANY language
so people writing gnue applications should be able to write 
applications only knowing their favorite language. 
However, creating an 'alternate' 
implementation of the tool is a lot of maintainance and 
duplication (but as stated we have samples in cvs so its 
doable). Python is about as portable as it gets - i.e. 
from handhelds to mainframes. He also noted 
there is a native gtk2 
version of Forms in 
cvs in case wxpython is one of your concerns.","2002-10-28","53"
"1778","764","2","Bill said I am using a similar 
designer via glade that's tied to scheme in the same way; 
I just happen to like scheme more :) The nice thing about 
the gnue designer is the twist you guys put on it to support 
character cell layout. I am pretty likely to be doing a 
significant chunk of ERP type stuff for some car dealerships 
and I was hoping to give/take some with gnue, but I don't 
think I'm ready to switch the tools over to python. 
He did not have anything against 
python, I just like lispy languages better.  guile has its 
limitations but at least I know what they are. 
Derek said guile/scheme looks 
very cool - problem is it has a big learning curve compared 
to python for business programmers. I dont think that makes 
it bad, just we tried to pick something closer to our target 
market plus larger programmer base. He suggested 
the 'right' thing to do if you 
wanted to do this and not loose scheme is adopt the formats
i.e. keep own designer - just make it write out gfd's and 
grd's - then make a forms client in scheme. This shouldnt be 
overly difficult - and it woudl actually give you 
compatiability to GNUE - i.e. a form you write should be 
usable by python clients as long as you are in spec - 
especially once we have cross language trigger support.
He noted we are getting ready 
to rollout quite a bit of application base very soon - 
geared towards manufacturing - but most of it would be 
relevant to car dealerships too - as keeping books and paying 
bills is pretty universal :).","2002-10-28","53"
"1779","764","3","Nick Rusnov (nickr) said Seems 
like the gfds should allow you to say 'this trigger uses this 
interpreter'. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
we have that functionality, just no 
sublanguages - all triggers support a language="""" attribute -
just right now, ""python"" is the only valid answer :). 
Nick asked does the forms client 
really have to be written in the same lanugage as the 
triggers? Derek said not - 
the idea is that python version 
will support triggers in ANY language that 
someone writes a wrapper 
for.","2002-10-28","53"
"1780","764","4","Derek asked whether we 
could make designer work same way for plugins? i.e. could we 
make the plugin architecture support other languages? 
Jason said I suppose so - but that's 
a slightly different audience - /me isn't sure of the benefits
- but it is certainly doable. Derek said that
if we make a concession for 
business applications to be outside of python (the biz 
logic/triggers) - would it make sense to offer this 
flexibiltiy for designer plugins as well. As Designer 
evolved, so that everything 
almost is done via plugin - we might get more stuff written 
if we offer to let poeple write in language of choice
- or at least python/scheme/perl.","2002-10-28","53"

I'd be willing to do that if they don't

you could review them for 'suckage' - and if they dont suck take 
over the packages and get what we have uploaded to debian?

"1782","765","2","Later, Nicholas Lee (esands) noted that the old packages for 
gnue-common, gnue-designer and gnue-forms all had outstanding bugs
in the Debian bug tracking system. James said people could 
add a line to their sources.list 
and just apt-get the new stuff - deb http://www.gnuenterprise.org/debian 
woody main. These were the Debian packages that Jason 
Cater (jcater) had prepared, based on those for Zope. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) asked Are they going into unstable 
at all? James said we don't have 
a clue how to make it happen. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
they probably will if you spruce them up 
:). Jeff said I can make that happen 
easily enough. Especially since we might start using gnue here. 
=) James said i'd love to see them 
in the Debian testing distribution (as of time of writing, 
sarge) as well - but I know they have to 
play nice in unstable for a while. Jeff said that, at the 
moment, Debian unstable is still suffering 
with the glibc 2.3 transition and the perl transition, 
although this should not affect python-based packages like GNUe.","2002-10-28","53"
"1783","765","3","Jason said whatever you do - PLEASE keep 
the changes in CVS - I have all my debian files in our cvs 
structure. James agreed - we 
tried time and time again to get the files and a simple how-to in 
cvs - but people treated us like we were derek and just ignored 
us :) Jason said we can maintain 
them - I don't mind that - we just need a sponsor. 
James agreed - we just need someone 
wise to tell us what hoops to jump thru - personally I'd like to 
see the maintainer listed as the project itself - as the orphan 
problem seems to haunt debian projects. Nicholas said 
No rush though to get the debs back in.  
Can always do maintain it external and pass it to a debian 
maintainer to commit to the rep. James agreed - 
we have external repository now - 
i set that up about a month ago using jcater's debs.","2002-10-28","53"
"1784","765","4","Jeff suggested setting up a small mailing list at 
lists.debian.org to do the bug tracking for the packages. 
Nicholas suggested WHy not just 
debian@gnue.org ? Derek suggested 
if debian bug tracker has 
to email something - howabout debian-support@gnuenterprise.org
- thsi way it will file bugs automagically into DCL - and 
we can have one 'official' person in charge - but certainly 
others can put on watches or the likes. Jeff said 
That's probably suboptimal, since 
then you'd have two bug tracking systems. Derek 
said he wanted to let people use the Debian bug 
tracker system to log the bug
- and we just do something clever to have DCL report back 
to BTS on things - this way our developers have a single 
system but people can still file bugs via BTS. i.e. im not 
against BTS - but we need to have bugs in one place for us
- and dcl is that place. Jeff said it was 
normally Debian Developpers job to 
handle bugs and file them upstream when needed. 
Derek said well i would 
consider this no different - just our debian developer is 
a 'collective borg' - and so it auto forwards everything 
upstream :) since the GNUe project would have 
committed to also maintain the debian package for itself.
Jeff said Tell you what - I'll upload 
it at first sending the bugs to me.  When you get it wired 
up, lemme know. =).","2002-10-28","53"
"1785","765","5","Jeff reviewed the new packages before uploading them - 
it looks like baux orphaned all of 
the gnue stuff. So it won't be a problem for me to pick it 
up. He asked whether gnue 
uses zope? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
nope - not at all - 
jcater just based the 
debs off zope's packaging :). Jeff pointed out 
that the README still mentioned Zope. Jason said 
the README was one of the things 
i needed to touch up - as well as our description: 
fields. He also wondered what 
kind of bribe it'd take to get him (or someone) to get 
nickr's pysablot debs, as discussed in

in unstable? I do know those need 
to be renamed to python's standard (which I guess would 
be python2.2-sablotron) ?? Since sablotron/pysablot 
was a dependancy for GNUe Reports, this

should ask him :).","2002-10-28","53"

- ImportError: No module named 
wxPython.wx. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
did you upgrade to unstable's

used python 2.2 as its standard instead of 2.1 - he 
suggested that Derek should apt-get 
install wxgtk2.3-python. Derek asked 
why didnt the DEPENDENCIES pick 
up something - i.e. why 
did it switch my python to 2.2 but not fricken grab its 
dependencies? He noted that most python-based 
packages in Debian used python 2.3 now. Jason said that, 
according to the python website, 2.3 was not out yet - 
and they say debian is behind - 
bullshit! - unstable is so damn current, it has software that

official release.","2002-10-28","53"
"1787","766","2","Jason noted that the plans for python 2.3 included 
a lot of changes - 
they have a bool() datatype,

wonders what you get if you 
apt-get install python2.3 :) Jason said 
I would be afraid. 
Derek said if you have to PORT
- shouldnt it be 3.0? Jason said that the 
thing is it's ALWAYS that the new 
version enforces a language rule that they were lax in before.
So the code, once ""ported"", still works in the older 2.x 
version :) e.g., 2.2 really enforced namespace scope rules

"1788","767","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) said the designer 
schema wizard kicks some arse. He asked whether the .gsd 
(GNUe Schema Definition) output file should be 
ONE giant schema? or one per 
table? Jason said we've had this 
debate before, in 
.
He said I *think* the outcome is we should 
support some kidn of <import> mechanism. Derek 
agreed - if we coudl 'include' (or 
import) then single was probably 
better.","2002-10-28","53"
"1789","767","2","Derek said he was SO impressed to 
see you could pick table listings - only thing missing is it needs 
to pop a dialog when done - saying 'done' - i just noticed that 
the term window stopped spitting out debug messages :)
Jason said that this would not be an issue 
once we have an editor :). 
Derek noted that the wizard had translated a postgreSQL field 
of type numeric(12,2) to 
<field name=""amount"" size=""786438"" type=""number""/>.
Jason suggested somethings screwy with 
the introspection. Derek did some poking around 
inside PostgreSQL and discovered that the data dictionary 
had a field ""atttypmod"" which contained the mystery 
786438 value - obviously a look-up to another table of 
valid numeric types - guess 
we need to learn 'conversion magic'. Jason said 
ah, crap... we are obviously 
misinterpreting what atttypmod means - 
postgres catalog table doesn't 
store like I expected. Derek was convinced he 
was a walking light bulb 
(fricken bugs are attracted to me).","2002-10-28","53"

Sure, I could probably do something like 
that. However

pretty good. Derek explained one

Ndicholas said it Has some nice 
screenshots. Although it looks like it suffers from 
the same us-centric issue of only dealing with sales tax on

be impossible or (costly). Nicholas suggested 
Probably defense industry

Nola/acclite is still there only because you guys are working on

"1793","769","1","Further to 
, 
it was noted that GNUe looked for a particular Oracle listener, using the 
service name from connections.conf. Oracle's own SQL*Plus tools looked 
for the default listener. This was with running both SQL*Plus and GNUe 
on the same machine as the database server. Jason Cater (jcater)
explained when running on the server, sqlplus 
can use interprocess communications to talk with the server - we can't 
- we can only do it via tcp/ip. This had never been an issue 
for him, as I am running Oracle in client/server
- nothing but oracle runs on the server. This meant that the 
connections information was taken from the TNSNAMES.ORA file as 
well as listener.ora. There should be no problem running GNUe and 
the Oracle database on the same machine, but 
you'll still need a listener running though 
: :). He volunteered to send his Oracle configuration 
files to help. The problem turned out to be that the name of the 
service was different to the (SERVICE=) entry in the 
tnsnames.ora file, which was concerning, as this file had been 
automatically generated by the Oracle tools, so therefore should 
not have gone wrong. It was asked if there was any way to 
verify the file. Jason said I don't know
- I had a hard time setting mine up the first time - when I finally 
got a working version several years ago - I never touched it 
again.","2002-10-30","54"
"1794","770","1","Further to 
, 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that savannah hackers had queried his 
project submissions, asking for an URL to 
the source code tarball. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said this
was just to check licensing. 
Jason said I am creating new projects, though
- how can they check licensing for something I'm going to do?. 
Andrew said you said for RentFree that 
you had source, they'll check that the files have the proper copyright 
into. Jason said I already indicated 
that it was gpl. Andrew replied as 
do a lot of people - but people seem to have a knack for missing copyright 
headers on source files. Projects that i've submitted have been rejected 
& told to resubmit, too. Do you have any code/forms/stuff for 
gnue-sb? If not, he would need to explain that to them. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) noted that GNUe seemed to be the only GNU project 
that was consciencious in getting copyright assignments from contributors, 
so it was a bit galling that they are worried 
one of our SUB PROJECTS might not have good license? Jason said 
he did not mind so much that they needed clarification on something, but 
was surprised that it had taken two days to get back to him on it. 
Andrew said if you saw the pile of projects 
that are in the submission queue....","2002-10-30","54"
"1795","770","2","
The next day, Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted that Jason's 
submissions were being discussed on the savannah-hackers 
mailing list. He reminded Jason that he would have 
to resubmit, which means using the 
URL provided -  this is because once they have been declined for 
whatever reason, the system is designed for you to have to 
resubmit :) Jason was not very impressed with this - 
no history information? bah. 
Andrew said that savannah had been forked from the last 
public version of sourceforge, so shared many of its 
limitations. Jason said the free software way was to 
hack it to be better.","2002-10-30","54"
"1796","770","3","Jason was also confused, as They 
asked me if I wanted to be a part of the GNU project on the 
registration screen, which he had replied yes to. 
They were now asking for proof of this, but the question 
had been whether he wanted to be, not whether he already 
was. Andrew said i told them that 
GNUe subprojects should be considered part of GNUe (as if my 
opinion matters ;).","2002-10-30","54"
"1797","770","4","Jason also raised the issue of how he should mark the 
code as being under the GPL (GNU General Public License) - 
I have a COPYING file - however - 
All the ""code"" is really GFD files - is it going to come back to 
bite me that there's not copyright headers in the GFD files?
or is the COPYING file enough? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) 
said the COPYING file states that 
you should have headers in each source code file.
Jason said the thing is, the GFD files 
are automatically generated by Designer - 
so keeping a header in there will be a 
biotch. Andrew suggested 
perhaps go the nasty way & have 
a license tag for forms - so that designer can generate copyright 
header in xml comments.","2002-10-30","54"
"1798","770","5","Derek Neighbors (derek) said he thought that 
the gfds should have the copyright 
header - its not MANDATORY - the COPYING file is enough - but it 
is better to have in GFDs as well. Jason said he would 
put them in manually for now. Derek said the long-term solution 
was in designer allow a 'preferences'
that lets you put in custom headers - and wehn you make gfd's 
you can choose from those. Jason said 
I think once I get ""projects"" working in 
Designer this will be the appropriate place for that - 
as on the ""project"" config screen, you could say ""place xxxx 
copyright header in all G?D files"". Derek said this 
is GREAT for two reasons - 
a. you dont have to manually fight designer - 
b. it will add headers so you dont forget :) - /me is VERY 
guilty of b. Jason felt it should not be 
a system-wide preference - as I work 
on all kinds of projects w/gnue - public, gpl'd projects - 
internal projects and so on. Derek said 
i would do a 'profiles' thing
and then be able to set it by project - i.e. you could have a 
GPL profile, BSD, company foo etc.","2002-10-30","54"
"1799","770","6","
The next day, 
Derek noted that the project page for GNUe Small Business was 
now on savannah - i have code to 
actually already check into cvs - just getting cvs ready - 
hopefully by monday it will be 'official' - and you can checkout 
code and everything for contacts and product management. 
He explained its a SUB project of 
GNUe - the 'official' gnue applications will be made using the 
appserver and will be much more intensive - the 'small business' 
applications are 'official', but more a side addition - they will 
be released much sooner but will not use appserver.","2002-10-30","54"
"1800","770","7","Derek also noted we are starting 
the legal battles to get fedex and ups api for shipping management 
as free software - but regardless of how we release it that is 
being worked on as well - sales order, invoicing, shipping 
management, contact management, inventory/product management 
should be within next 30 - 60 days. Charles Rouzer 
(Mr_You) asked how are other free 
solutions connecting to UPS/Fex? Derek replied
they arent or they are doing so 
illegally - the way it looks right now (at least for fedex) is 
that if you write a solution you can not distribute it - whether 
its 'free software' or 'propreitary' software. He said 
we have some issues to resolve legally 
- we are going by the letter of the fedex contract (not us, but 
real lawyers reviewing) - we will likely try to communicate with 
them to get written consent to develop free software using the 
api's in some form or another - as the other alternative is to 
'reverse engineer' and play samba like api madness - which we 
certainly could do if necessary. He was not tempted to 
just download the api and write 
something and distribute under gpl as 
if fedex found out and got pissed 
off, they could kill the project dead. The worst case 
scenario was that the shipping management would have to be 
done as proprietary software that 
interfaces with gnue but we 
would MUCH rather it be free software.","2002-10-30","54"
"1801","770","8","Derek said that the 'code' for GNUe Small Business was 
pretty much all schema's and xml 
files - which is what is great - entire applications beeing xml 
and db schema. Actually i think in the product management stuff 
for right now i only have 1 trigger :) - and that is to over come 
an oddity in my ui refreshing :) to refresh a list of 
foreign keys for a dropdown, as discussed in 
.","2002-10-30","54"
"1802","770","9","
The next day, Derek cut and pasted his initial CVS check-in 
for GNUe Small Business. Nicholas Lee (esands) noted the 
GNUe Schema Definition (.gsd) files in the check-in and 
asked I assume designer reads gsd 
files and outputs sql? Derek said 
kind of - 
gsd is an xml file - 
currently you use xslt and an xsl (style sheet) - 
and it makes a sql file. At the moment, he did this 
from the command line, but it was intended that Designer 
should do this directly in the future, and it might do 
so already. He noted the code for the XSLT was 
all in gnue-common iirc 
- gnue/common/utils/xml2sql/ i 
think has the stylesheets. Nicholas asked 
what deb is PySablot?. 
Derek said that the pysablot debs 
arent in sid yet :( - working on it - they are on our 
website 
though :). He warned that the .gsd-handling code 
in CVS was temporarily broken as of time of writing, which 
Nicholas confirmed - Derek was using a slightly older copy 
that still worked, as i have 
real world deadlines and others have needs that are watiing 
on us - so expect gnue-sb to move at fairly steady pace 
compared to how gnue apps have gone in the past.","2002-10-30","54"
"1803","771","1","Neil Tiffin (neilt) said he wanted to 
build business objects - and as long as we have a agreed aproach that 
works,  he was happy to see the work 
progressing - . Reinhard noted we 
have finally agreed on storing the class definitions in the database - or 
to be more precise in ""system business objects"". 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) noted well I 
have a parser commited for ODL that uses PLY in case no one noticed, 
but I need to make it parse into something like perhaps an AST. 
Reinhard confirmed this had been discussed, 
as well as about comparable things that 
only exist more or less as an idea - and we agreed that it is a good 
thing to have parsers for other formats - that can read ""external"" 
defined objects and ""merge"" that into the ""main"" repository as a 
separate command line tool. Neil felt 
the back end for storing business objects
should be plugable just in case we want to change it. 
Reinhard agreed - that's why made it a 
separate ""module"".","2002-11-02","54"
"1804","771","2","Daniel said I figured using an xml 
markup as an exchange format between designer and appserver would be 
nice too - since designer probably wants xml. He pointed out 
that it is supposed to be our IDE isn't 
it? jcater made it so you could write plugins. Reinhard 
suggested we could even have some 
""normal"" form that accesses these metaobjects.","2002-11-02","54"
"1805","771","3","Neil asked can business objects be 
aggregates of other business objects? - for example,
so the GUI can just request the sale 
order and get all the header and items on the sales order
at once. Reinhard suggested this might not be a good idea, as 
the sales order might have 1000 
items on it - and the gui doesn't want to load all 1000 at 
once. Neil said he was used to business objects 
corresponding with a form - this 
business object can be a real object or a proxy object for 
several real business objects - but this means that some of the 
complexity of the GUI is moved to the business object. 
Reinhard felt that the appserver 
shouldn't deal with visualisation of data - 
if we define those ""form-bound"" 
business objects - we move parts of the form definitions into 
appserver. Neil agreed about visualisation, but said 
if we dont have compound 
business objects we move linking all 
of the data to the form - if links 
also have to be defined by the form 
so the work to maintain it will be double. 
The forms or appserver will be fragile 
to breaking if one is changed but not the other.","2002-11-02","54"
"1806","771","4","Reinhard felt we will always 
have this issue as long as form definitions (XML) and object 
definitions (database) are maintained seperately - 
that a form definition doesn't match the underlying 
object. Neil said that compound business objects 
should actually help with this, as the compound object could 
be changed to pick up a property from a different child 
business object, but still present it as the same field to 
the form. Reinhard understood this, but did not see 
how this could 
work with 1:n instead of 1:1. Neil admitted 
thats is the downside - 
in that you hide the relationships in the proxy objects 
and the forms just deal with data - but the upside is that i 
can add a complex stored procedures to retreive data into and
object and the form does not need to know the relationship - 
only that it should display the data. Reinhard asked 
but the form has to know that it's 
master detail doesn't it? Otherwise 
how does the form know that it can 
insert a new item into the order? Neil said 
the list is either read only or read 
write - if the list is added to then the business object 
maintains referrential integrity when it updates the db.","2002-11-02","54"
"1807","771","5","Reinhard asked how does the form 
know that i can add another item to the order - but i can not 
add another customer? well i can _change_ the customer. 
Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) said it 
shouldn't display stuff to add a customer then ;) - or the gui 
should be 'disabled' - forms has read-only widgets. 
Reinhard suggested what you are 
talking about means that we have some ""array"" type of 
property. Daniel said which 
in ODL would be a ref to a collection ;) - cause relationships 
and attributes are the object ""properties"".","2002-11-02","54"
"1808","771","6","Neil emphasised that these were just his initial thoughts 
and i dont want to get in the way of 
progress. Reinhard agreed - one of the themes of the 
meeting had been to reduce discussion in future and implement 
possible solutions - look where 
we will have the _real_ problems - and improve that. 
He felt that the discussion he and Jan had had about 
the AppServer API in 
 
was a good example of this - with 
jforms siesel found out we have to change it to make performance 
better - so we changed it - but if we hadn't done that prototype 
implementation - we would never ever have seen the real

having to import the library in every trigger, for example - maybe I 
understood too much. Jason said you

available to every trigger in the form, giving an example -

define a base currency - and then all transactions in GL store amount in base 
currency, amount in foreign currency, name of foreign currency. To get ""true"" 
trial balance you do select sum (base_amt) from balances ;
Nicholas said That's need for tax purposes and need 
for in order to rationalise transactions within the GL.  From a business 
management point of view though you need reconcile transactions and deal 
with making profit over multiple currencies Peter felt 
only if that's useful management information to 
you - I could imagine a biz not caring how much profit they made in Aussie 
dollars, just how much they made on product category X.","2002-10-31","54"
"1824","779","3","Nicholas asked What's the general rule of thumb 
in the UK regarding balance date base currency valutions of a foreign bank 
account? Peter disclaimed I'm not an 
expert on forex, but I believe this is where unrealised gain/loss on forex 
comes in - for balance sheet purposes 
you convert at prevailing exchnage rate at 31st Decembefr - The difference 
between this and what the amount in your books is constitues (IIRC) the 
unrelised gain or loss. He gave a simple example of an unrealised 
gain. The main issue (i am not a lawyer, 
especially a tax lawyer) is how taxman wants you to treat this.","2002-10-31","54"
"1825","779","4","Nicholas asked what exchange rate to use - 
the given rate on that day? or by the internal 
rate of sumif(GBP)/sumif(USD)? Peter said 
I would always go far a ""daily"" rate in this 
day and age - with computers to do the work for us - monthly rates are less 
accurate - taxman might have a view too. Nicholas said 
I'll have to think how to use that in the context 
of hedging your transactions. Peter said 
hedging if used properly is just a way of 
realising the potential gain/loss - i.e. take a forward position for when 
you expect the transaction to settle (for an invoice, typically 30 
days). Nicholas said Depends on the terms, 
for instance many of our transactions are 90 day - foreign exchanges ones 
that is.","2002-10-31","54"
"1826","779","5","Nicholas asked I assume a form of that triple 
is used in the Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable ledgers 
as well. Peter agreed - once the transaction 
is settled (i.e. paid) you'd have a trigger to work out the *realised* 
gain/loss and post that right away. Nicholas said 
Actually the commerical system we use, generates 
the variances both on posting (month end) and payment.","2002-10-31","54"
"1827","779","6","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted that, in Austria and Germany, 
for the balance, you may not consider unrealized 
forex gains - and you _have_to_ consider unrealized forex losses - 
so you always have to use the ""worst case"" in the balance. 
Nicholas was surprised they don't try get more 
tax by requiring realisation of gains though. Must be nicer now you have 
the euro. Reinhard said the aim was to ensure 
that the balance shouldn't look better 
than it really should be. Nicholas said 
Doesn't that depend on your point of view?  
Although the balance in both currencies in the balance sheet is an average 
of past transactions.  At given moment it can be realised into the base 
currency. All past rates are in the past and all future rates unknown.  
Thus there is no true better or worse. Still I agree its better just 
realising fx losses. Otherwise it could cause undue hardship on a businesses 
cashflow. Reinhard agreed, but said 
with the worst case view it's shure the 
balance doesn't look better than the real future outcome will be - 
it might probably look worse - but that's actually the point of a worst 
case view :).","2002-10-31","54"
"1828","780","1","Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked how can 
you do secure db connections with GNUe? 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
we have full security wrapper 
now - i.e. plugin - that you can use kerberos, pam, etc. 
currently we use ssh - 
so the client is on my machine i 
ssh tunnel port 5342 to the internet machine postgres is 
on. Charles asked how this would work with client PCs
running Microsoft Windows. Derek said they could use 
putty which was a free 
ssh client written native for Win32 - cygwin was not needed. 
we will likely add this as a plugin 
to the framework - so it will create tunnels everything on fly 
for you. the idea would be 
to have this wizard be in the framework and then execute the script 
on demand - instead of have to run externally. 
Charles noted you guys run GNUe 
locally.. but there are TONS of small business people that would 
rather run their small biz software remotely and not worry about a 
server or anything.. its harder to sell a ""hacked"" solution like 
ssh tunnel until its seamlessly integrated... 
Calum Morrell (drochaid) asked err, how 
is an ssh tunnel ""hacked"" in any sense? it's a fairly standard 
security consideration. Charles said 
my definition of ""hacked"" in this case 
means.. to the end user (newbie).. it may seem ""hacked together"" 
for them.. if they have to install more than one package and 
configure this and that.. rather than just configuring a GNUe Forms 
client. Derek said the ssh 
stuff would be IN the client - i.e. to a lay person it woudl be 
click button enter username and passowrd - nothing more nothing 
less. Even now, it is install 
gnue install putty and click such and such to configure remote server 
done - if you were 'deploying' 
you could actually precreate the script - and they wouldnt do 
anything but connect.","2002-11-01","54"

Developers ;-) like me ;-) - not python coders.

jasons home directory i think - as its a work in progress","2002-11-01","54"
"1830","781","2","
The next day, Jason Cater (jcater) asked have 
you given any thought on how to handle our new GNUe/Small Business 
Edition for the website. I 
think derek and I were leaning towards keeping it as GNUe
(and so having it be a part of GNUe's website, somehow) - 
we just wanted a separate CVS tree. Peter said 
I think I would just add gnue-sb to 
the ""Applications"" section of the site, noting that 
registering the project in CVS at savannah, the FSF's free 
equivalent to sourceforge, would automatically create a web 
page for the project on the www.gnu.org website. Jason said 
we are **strongly** considering going 
to this gnue-??? model for all our gnue stuff with 
seperate CVS repositories for gnue-forms, 
gnue-reports, etc. Peter said this 
gives us an auto structure for the 
web site too - as each gnue-foo will have its own mini site on 
www.gnu.org - with /software/gnue/ as the official entry 
point. Jason said actually, 
that is one of our hangups - as we were expecting it to be harder 
to do the website :) However, 
this would let gnue.org be more of a 
community site like derek's always clamoring for - as we would 
always have easily accessible tool sites Peter said 
well, www.gnuenterprise.org already 
has things that we wouldn't ever put on www.gnu.org - e.g. the 
irc logs.","2002-11-01","54"
"1831","781","3","Calum asked whether the website should 
give documentation a much more prominent 
position? Peter said Documentation 
is a funny one - as we only have 1 docs page at the moment - but there 
are at least 3 levels - a) end user docs, b) application developer 
docs (people designing apps with gnue), c) GNUe developer docs. 
Calum said I always find it's one of the 
most important link .. and just now it's the 2nd last item on the 
menu, or into community and the 2nd last item, there - he 
like to see ""GNUe Docs"" beside ""GNUe 
Community"" in the top header. Peter said that 
Short term, I may as well go back to the 
old ""fudge"" - which is to have Docs listed in both Project 
(loghically just under ""Downloads"") - and also in Community as 
well until there were enough documents of different types to 
warrant two pages. Calum suggested adding another major category 
down the left hand side for Documentation, and adding a tab across 
the top. Peter noted that the tabs across the top related to the 
three bullet points on the Home Page about ""What is GNUe?"" - 
Tools, Applications and Community, but he supposed he could 
say that GNue was 4 things, one of which 
is a repository of docs.","2002-11-01","54"
"1832","781","4","Jason was not keen on another tab across 
the top - I think we have about as many tabs as we can realistically 
put there. Instead, I think each 
tab deserve's its own doc page - if 
we have a centralized doc page I think it's going to be so 
confusing. Calum felt if someone 
isn't sure which category a doc is likely to be in, could piss them 
off trying to find it. Jason outlined how his idea would 
work - the Forms/ page would still list 
all the form-related docs - but from the main menu, you could 
quickly get to all tool-related docs too.","2002-11-01","54"
"1833","781","5","Jason said one of the things we've been 
emphasizing over the last month or so is that the tools get lost in 
the apps - so we're trying to point out that GNue is 3 projects in one. 
I just think the documentation should follow in that focus as well - 
and I'm talking at a minimum here. Calum said 
whereas I would always classify documention 
as a separate project, as without really good docs, the tools/apps 
are useless to the less than technical users. Peter felt 
we need a lot more docs before any of 
this matters - but that will come.","2002-11-01","54"

a quick question about the security adapter layer... noticed that ldap

plugins) - ldap doesn't seem like nearly enough for enterprise security

wondering if this project is going to have a huge dependecy on active

layer? Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said GNUe

language - we build the architecture :). Jason Cater (jcater) 
explained our main goal with gnue appserver 
is centralizing business application rules - business logic, if you 
will - note that we aren't building 
a generic, all purpose application server. Derek pointed to

two very different projects, but there had been discussions on 
working together in two areas. The first was GNU-RPC -

was talk by dotGNU folks to look at appserver as something they 
are interested in as a basis for their own web-based 
application server. Andrew, as the 
main person who has feet in both projects, said that 
the gnu-rpc implementation will be 
getting worked on next week - 
and appserver will be used
by DotGNU  where it 
suits  - if GNUe's appserver 
is not suitable for more generic tasks, then we'll sort something 
else out :). He explained gnu-rpc 
is an abstraction layer to allow multiple transports to be 
used (SOAP, CORBA and XML-RPC) - Derek explained 
think perl-dbi only for rpc 
mechanisms - again its written in python. Andrew 
said he was planning to write a version of GNU-RPC in C# for 
DotGNU. Derek said that jcater is one

without writing one trigger per

triggers to return a true or false based on success/failure
- so if a failure was returned everything stops. 
John said yeah, but the page has 
already changed, even at the point the pre-focusout
trigger was called. Jason said then 
that's a bug w/page changing. John expressed some 
frustration with the wxpython GUI toolkit, but recognised 
why GNUe used it, as it allowed cross-platform GUI so easily. 
the worst bug is the 
widget-seems-to-get-focus-but-doesn't - that confuses the 
hell out of people. This was 
the one where you point at 
an entry but just on the border so the cursor isn't acutally

"1846","788","1","James Thompson (jamest) said for 
all the appserver developers in the house - jcater and myself 
are wanting to do a normal release of common, forms, reports, designer
- then do what I've been calling a spitshine release at (0.5.0). 
meaning the next release is 0.4.1 - then 0.5.0 comes out with no 
new functionality - (I'm talking common version numbers btw) - 
we've instead focus on code cleanup, docs, bugfixes -  
0.4.1 would be basically cvs that we 
have now. However, how would 
this effect appserver? do we need to hold off on a common freeze 
for a while to get some features needed in there? 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) felt it 
would be better to do both 0.4.1 _and_ 0.5.0 of common 
_before_  the Application Server team started ""breakage""
by adding the features they needed to Common.
However it would be good to ask 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) too - 
because he's exactly the one that can answer this question - 
he always was the personified interface between common and appserver 
:) - and at our meeting he talked about some points he wants to 
change in common - however i didn't get the feeling that they were 
_urgent_. James said ok, the 
main reason I ask is we don't want the appserver needs to not get 
met - and I'd hate to try and say ""no new features"" if it hurts 
appserver. I'd rather do a series of 0.4.x releases to get what 
you require in there first - we've kind of promised ourselves no 
common|forms|designer 0.5.0 without good docs. Well, one thing that 
I hope to get into 0.4.1 is autodoc support for triggers in the base 
apps - so that it'll be easier to create them for 0.5.0 :) autodoc

GNUe, so that he could get them into sid (the Debian unstable 
distribution. Derek Neighbors (derek) asked 
can you commit them to cvs? 
Jeff suggested some possible changes to the CVS structure to make 
this easier - The way I do the packaging is 
that the upstream source is just a tarball sitting in the deb.  
That way upgrades are mostly just replacing the tarball.
I will cheerfully keep that in cvs if you'd like - that would be easy 
enough - but I'd make a new toplevel ""packaging/debian/PACKAGENAME/"" 
probably... Jason wondered if his original Debian packages 
should have been marked as for woody (as of time of writing, the 
Debian stable distribution), as they rely 
on python 2.1 stuff. Jeff found and Jason fixed various 
bugs and other oddities in CVS (such as image files that had the 
executable flag set). Jeff explained I'm 
taking a tarball of the CVS tree and stuffing it into my packaging.
Which is mostly jcaters packaging. Jason said 
I actually thought you weren't supposed 
to package against a cvs tree directly - that's why I worked from 
the source tarball of the 0.4.0 releases. Jeff said 
It depends on the maintainer. I only 
package against CVS when I'm friends with upstream.

like - i package from cvs for DotGNU stuff - because i am part of 
upstream :).","2002-11-04","54"

would probably look to do Debian packages for once they were 
a bit more mature. there probably

100% complete. 
Jeff said Even if they're partially 
complete that's fine. The GNU project doesn't support man pages,

Jan Ischebeck (siesel), the members of project Papo - 
I *know* I missed someone... so don't take 
it personally. James Thompson (jamest) sniffed 
now we know how he feels about my

started coding more and more - you've always coded.","2002-11-04","54"
"1856","792","1","Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said The 
version number in Debian is going to be 20021105. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) was not keen on this, 
unless this is the 
2million, 21 thousand, and fifth debian revision :). 
Jason explained that, for help desk purposes, the About 
box in the CVS version of Forms said it was 0.4.1a 
(""a"" for ""alpha"") - but it will 
become 0.4.1 when released. It was noted that 
Debian - and other packaging systems - would regard 
0.4.1a as a later version than 0.4.1. Jason said that 
it was not really possible to change this before 
0.4.1 was released - James Thompson (jamest) 
suggested going straight to 0.4.2.","2002-11-04","54"
"1857","792","2","Derek Neighbors (derek) said the project 
might as well release 0.5.0
- we have no method right now (seriously) - other than 
chaos - its completely abitrary. 
there is no 'roadmap' that 
states what release is what - so there is no control - 
at which point who cares if its 0.4.1 or 0.5.0 (independent 
of the alpha question) - there is nothing stating what 
features will be in what releases - so USERS have no idea 
until something is released what is what. Jason said 
we have our internal markers - 
a lot is dependent on whether common's API changed - 
if common's API is vastly different, it has to be a major 
point release. Derek said 
until now its been no big deal - 
as we didnt have mass of other developers - and we didnt have 
production users. Jason said 
it's not perfect, nor well planned
- but it's not arbitrary.","2002-11-04","54"
"1858","792","3","Derek said we need to very 
soon get to the point where we really maintain 2 releases - 
so that someone on an old release can expect to get their bugs 
fixed - but not expect a bunch of expiremental features or 
major breakage. James said 
i thought someone was going to 
backport patches if we tagged cvs? Derek said 
that would be me - 
my problem is cvs commits are going like mad - 
but the cvs commit messages frankly suck - and there is no 
roadmap or system used to manage what should be backported. 
My proposal is we have a strict feature roadmap for the new 
releases and only if some feature is minor in nature does it 
get backported.","2002-11-04","54"
"1859","792","4","James said i can't see that 
working with free labor. Derek emphasised 
i never said 'put dates on 
features'. James explained 
what I'm saying is that like 
tonight - i finally got sick of the no query by detail - 
so I'm fixing it. This isn't on any roadmap - other than 
I'm sick of it. Derek said he was 
not saying that roadmaps cant 
change - the importance of the roadmap was that it 
provided a place to park feature requests for the future 
rather than the next immediate release - 
at some point one has to say 
this road is closed - creeping featurism had been 
had been a factor in the length of time taken over the 
last two GNUe releases. This had affected GNUe's relationship 
with other projects, including papo.","2002-11-04","54"
"1860","792","5","Also, with a roadmap, it would be possible to split 
changes in CVS head between bug fixes to existing features 
(which would get ported back to interim 'stable' releases) 
and new features which belonged only in the new release. 
James said nothing prevents that 
today however the API is constatnly in flux, we are a 0.5.0 
project - I can see something stable as we approach 
1.0. Derek said as we 
get more developers and more solid releases it will be 
mandatory to avoid chaos.","2002-11-04","54"
"1861","792","6","James said well, another way 
to approach this problem that i would prefer - an (semi-)
automated testing framework. Jason said 
I would too - and I've BEGGED people 
to do it. Derek agreed 
certainly that is necessary to 
help speed moving a release out the door - as thats one thing 
that has made the process difficult - feature freeze is called - 
and it takes too long to test to point where its too tempting 
to add new features in. Jason noted that 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) has even taken 
the initiative to start one in samples/testcases - but I don't 
see testcases flowing in. James said he had 
been adding to it for what I'm 
working on - but it's not standardized yet - was hoping to make 
it part of the 0.5.0 cleanup release. Daniel Baumann 
(chillywilly) noted there's different 
types of testing - black-box, white box, etc. - white box 
requires good knowledge of the code that is being tested - 
the *internals* of it - there's probably only 3 ppl right now 
that fit this description, imho - with perhaps a couple that 
have a decent understanding. James explained 
i wanted to make a gnue navigator 
thing - with various forms that had pages lableed step 1 2 3 4 
- and a final pass/fail step. Daniel said 
basically we need a testing team 
and/or go intoa  testing mode. James felt that 
anything is better than what we have 
now - which IIRC was jcater saying ""prereleases is here please 
test"" - then have people test after the final release.","2002-11-04","54"
"1862","792","7","Daniel said soem ppl can't code 
without some structure as they like to see down the ""road"" 
;) Derek said the people 
closest to gnue have the roadmap in their head - and cant see 
why anyone is frustrated that there is no structure - because 
when you are close to it, there appears to be structure (and 
there is) - just its not in a format that can be well 
shared. He was not so 
much requesting things be radically different than they are 
now, just that they be better presented to the public. 
Jason, referring back to 
, 
said we are already stretched pretty 
thin - the few of us. He felt it was unfair to 
suggest that the core developers were not responsive to end-user 
needs - I've spent a HELL of a lot of 
time on the developer's guide, which he personally had 
no need for. Derek said im willing 
to write up roadmaps and maintain a back branch - 
but not if i have to swim against the river to do it - 
i.e. if you and jamest loathe the idea of roadmaps i woudl rather 
not try to document whats in your heads for the public :). 
Jason alsoo objected you make it sound 
like we just only add new features and never look back - jamest 
and I take a release every so often - and do NOTHING but cleanup
and profiling, as planned for the 0.5.0 release. 
Derek said actually my complaint 
is you guys do far too much clean up :) - and my hope is to get 
to a point where others can 'clean up some' and you guys can add 
new cool stuff. Jason agreed, but said 
I would also like some donuts - but I 
don't have any - so it won't happen without extra 
volunteers. He felt over-managed on the project. Daniel 
said I think all FS projects could use 
a bit of management, however, I don't think they need ""managers"" 
;). Matt Rice (ratmice) suggested 
I think we need the man with the yellow 
hat from curious george books.","2002-11-04","54"
"1863","793","1","Ariel Calò (ariel_) said i've seen the 
new documentation of schema (gsd) - we have a type 'key' (old a
uto) that is translated to a db specific type, may be serial, 
int4 or whatsoever. Now a primary key has 2 functions: 1) enforce 
uniqueness of rows - 2) be referenced by foreign keys of other 
databases. Suppose i have a table with a field that references 
the primary key of another table - i want that field to have the 
same type of the pk in the other table. If i declare it of type 
key may be this is translated to serial (that i don't want since 
it is only a foreign key). i cannot declare it int4 (or similar) 
since i don't know how key is translated. i think a solution is 
another type fkey that is automatically translated by the specific 
driver to whatever is appropriate for the specific db 
backend. Jason Cater (jcater) pointed out that 
key != serial - there should be an 
auto="""" that makes it serial. So in the primary table you might 
have mykey -->   type=""key"" auto=""y"" - then in the referencing table
pointerToKey --> type=""key"".","2002-11-05","54"

Microsoft Windows 32 - with tabbed 
forms - when changing pages with mouse - after that going to  
the next record - the ""content"" doesn't refresh. 
He pointed to the area of the code which would mean that 
changing tabs with mouse will be 
OK - but PgDn/PgUp wrong - but it's only on win32 IIRC. 
James Thompson (jamest) suggested a possible work-around, but 
said he has no working win32 boxes 
handy to test this himself. Bajusz said 
i feel nobody likes to fix win32 bugs 
here :) James said i started 
hammering thru the dcl bugs last nite - so if they are in there 
I'll make as attempt to fix them. Jason Cater (jcater)

fix non-Win32 bugs vs Win32 - it's that we don;t have win32 
machines handy :( Bajusz said

important, cose most of GNUe users will use win clients

"1865","795","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked does 
anyone of you have an urgent need for integrator? 
Jason Cater (jcater) said relatively 
so - he had already started on
it - I think my latest stuff is in cvs. He added 
one of the biggest things I'll need to 
do next (That I haven't even started on) is a CSV / Flatfile 
dbdriver - even a simplistic one - as my plans for integrator 
are primarily mapping from source datasources to destination 
datasources. He explained this 
isn't actually to run apps against - I need to be able to load 
CVS files into my database and dump them from my database.
He certainly wouldn't plan on running 
forms against a CSV file, although it would be possible I 
suppose.... :) Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said 
i can try & start on one 
tomorrow if you'd like, not sure how you'd declare field names 
& stuff like that tho - as it would be useful for me as 
well. Jason said that's part 
of my hangup - I'm wondering about having a child node of 
datasource, where the flat file defintion would be 
included as part of the datasource definition - 
but am not sure the best 
approach. Andrew suggested 
for something quick & dirty, 
just name them 'column1' or 'field2', etc - would allow for 
conversion. Jan said if 
the flatfile dbdriver is just used for loading csv into 
integrator, why should we define special names for the 
fields - wouldn't a ""field_1"", ""field_2"" etc. be 
enought? Jason said I 
don't think it will necessarily be 1 way - but that's fine 
too - field_1 would work both ways. Andrew said 
some CSV files may have 
headers iirc. Jason said most 
loading software I see have a ""skipFirstRow"" option. 
Andrew said yep - that first row 
may contain field names if you're lucky. Jan 
would like to put all that stuff 
(skipFirstRow, delimiter....) into the connection.conf 
file. Both Jason and Andrew were keen on this. 
Jan said what about writing? Should 
read+write access be supported. (that would mean to rewrite 
the file after a COMMIT). Jason said 
I can see two options 1. 
skipFirstRow=0|1 or 2. useHeadersAsFields or soemthing 
like that - (they don't have to be exclusive) -
actually, skiprows shouldn't be 
boolean - it should be an integer - as I've gotten some funky 
stuff frm vendors before - esp. when they aren't using a 
real application but are instead doing in a spreadsheet and 
saving as csv. Jan suggested 
what about 
""firstRow=skip|fieldnames|data"" - Jason added 
and default to ""data"" ?","2002-11-05","54"
"1866","795","2","Jan noted IMHO the Integrator 
Proposal speaks of converting data from a datasource into 
XML, move it into a RULE ENGINE and export the XML into a 
datasource again. the RULE ENGINE is quite similar to a 
XSLT tranformation for me. So I would like to add a module, 
which does kind of XSLT transformations, but is written in 
python, to common. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked 
What's wrong with regular XSLT?
Use an XSLT namespace.... Like, if it's presenting as XML, 
you could just use <xsl:*> tags to embed commands 
in. Jan said I would 
just like to fake XML to the RULE ENGINE, because I don't 
think that it is good to convert huge database tables to 
XML just for fun. Jason said 
reports is a rule engine.
Jan asked so you would recommend 
to take code from reports to write integrator?
Jeff suggested, rather than re-use code from reports, 
Jan should move code into common 
and use in both reports and integrator.","2002-11-05","54"

"1868","796","1","Jeff Bailey (jbailey) noted that the gcc (GNU C Compiler)

use DCL should probably speak up. Derek Neighbors 
(derek) admitted im a dcl evangelizer
- BUT its more 'work order' oriented than software bug oriented - 
i.e. there are several features missing that would make it 
better specifically for bug tracking - 
but i think it does pretty darn 
good. He felt that with most 
software you hope you are doing more new work than fixing bugs - 
and i think DCL is FAR superior in task management - but weaker 
in bug management (though it does an ok job of this). If 
'versioning' stuff was beefed up a bit it would be pretty good - 
bugzilla is great for version management, but its really bad for 
end users to deal with (imho) i.e. its daunting to deal with

i setup the trigger namespace so it 
could be easily extended then I sat back and let others extend 
it - /me is lazy like that. I'm hoping that we can start looking 
at merging the two trees in the very near future - or at least 
setting them up as a branch in our cvs until we can work thru the 
changes.","2002-11-06","55"
"1870","798","1","Peter Sullivan (psu) said the web 
site has been updated to include brief descriptions 
of the non-main Forms clients. Jason Cater (jcater) 
said the Curses and GTK are slightly 
different than the others - java, emca, php are separate forms 
clients - curses, gtk, and wx are modes of our main, reference 
client. James Thompson (jamest) noted 
the java client is so old i bet it'd 
be a major overhaul to get it to even remotely function. 
Jason said it was just some code stubs in CVS. Charles Rouzer 
(Mr_You) said that Jans javascript 
code, as discussed in 
, 
could replace JForms. 
Jason noted that Javascript was not intended to be the 
definitive html mode for GNUe Forms, but encouraged Charles 
and Jan Ischebeck (siesel) to work on the Javascript version as 
an alternative. Charles felt it would be difficult to write 
an effective HTML client without using Javascript.","2002-11-06","55"
"1871","798","2","Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said there were two types of 
GNUe Forms client - ones that were in effect just UI drivers 
plugged into the main python code, and complete re-writes 
such as the phpForms and Javascript Forms client. Each of 
these two types could either official (in GNUe's CVS) or 
unofficial.","2002-11-06","55"
"1872","798","3","Charles noted that people could either use the normal 
Forms client in 2-tier mode, or the Javascript Forms client 
(which would require Application Server) in n-tier mode. 
Derek said the point of GNUe was that people could just 
use the tools they needed - you 
could use an HTML client w/ or w/o appserver - w/ or w/o 
reporter - w/ or w/o integrator. Charles appreciated
this, but asked how you would expect 
to get persistent connections using a webserver and HTML 
client? Derek said that he would expect an HTML client, 
just like the wxPython client, to allow devlopers to use 
either AppServer, or connect directly to the database using 
GNUe Common. Charles said this would still require an extra 
componant to make it ""persistant-like,"" whether that was 
Application Server or a web server. Jason said 
gnue-forms can stand by itself 
and communicate back to a webbrowser - there's no magic to 
that. It used the normal python libraries to, in 
effect, give itself a built-in web server for HTML 
clients - this formed the basis of 
the initial gnurpc implementation. This removed 
the need for either GNUe Application Server or a stand-alone 
web server running Forms via cgi.","2002-11-06","55"
"1873","798","4","Charles still felt that js 
is required for dynamic screen writes.. you build the layout 
code into JS then add on xmlrpc and 2-tier connectivity. 
Derek noted that there had been a UI driver for the standard 
Forms client that used webware to support HTML clients, which 
had worked to a degree. He felt that this approach would be 
less work than trying to rewrite the whole Forms client in 
either Javascript or even php. There was no reason why an HTML 
UI driver could not use Javascript for dynamic screen writes 
and so on, although Jason was keen for the HTML client to not 
require Javascript, but use if is if was available. Derek 
said the biggest thing that becomes 
an issue is client side triggers - but the data stuff and such 
i see no problems.","2002-11-06","55"
"1874","798","5","Jason said that a Forms client completely re-written in 
Javascript would probably be a better 
experience for the end-user BECAUSE it is a specific, targeted 
version of forms BUT that doesn't mean we don't want a version 
using our gnue-forms core as well. He was 
happy you guys are doing a jsforms 
client as another implementation 
will keep us in check and it will be something very useful 
but that doesn't negate use having a more 
general purpose one in gnue-forms even if it's not as robust/user 
friendly. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) concluded
1. choices are good - 2. there has to 
be ONE standart implementation (more than one will allways become 
unmaintainted) - 3. jsforms should be so modular that 
you can easily implement different set-ups.","2002-11-06","55"
"1875","798","6","Looking at the web site, James Thompson (jamest) wondered if it 
would be cleaner to have 1 page on the 
reference client with #section tags for the various drivers - 
as I know that I want to see a native win32 driver and a qt driver -
and I'm sure we need an emacs driver too :) Peter said 
The main justification for separate pages 
is that each mode of the ref client may have diff statuses - 
and it's confusing to have too many ""Status"" lines on one page. 
Jason said he would still rather see
information about other Forms clients in a subdirectory - 
as I think /tools/curses is ambiguous 
considering we have a curses navigator too. James added 
reports almost has a curses and wx mode i 
think. Peter said he would fix 
that in the pending site overhaul for when we get it into 
CVS.","2002-11-06","55"
"1876","799","1","Further to 
, 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said i think 
good things were discussed, but im curious about making db driver 
more complex than need be - as 
generally there are two types of things - csv files in which you wnat 
to read and write and csv files which are used to 'move' data. 
He agreed with Jason Cater (jcater) in the 
dont assume 1 line - some wierd files dont start data until two or 
three lines in He was not sure about random access read-write, 
however - i.e. is it only valid for 
import/export. Jason said well, 
I wouldn't expect to run GNUe Forms off of it - I suppose one 
""could"". Derek was not keen on defining CSV formats in the 
connections.conf file - he thought that sort of thing belonged in 
the .gmd (GNUe Mapping Definition) in Integrator. Jan agreed - 
if nothing else, the filenames would be changing even if the 
structure was not. Jason agreed - I'm 
really thinking, wherever you define it, this really boils down to 
a <datasource> issue - he felt both ways could be 
useful. ","2002-11-06","55"

, 
Derek said that integrator 
is just a different front end to reports. Jason said that 
it was a tool to provide a mapping layer between datasources 
to do complex stuff (with triggers if need 
be). in my mind.. it's reports with 
a SINGLE destination... another datasource :) Derek felt 
that the CSV driver to me is a HUGE 
first step for integrator - ie. i have needs for integrator but 
mostly with CSV - as soon as we have CSV driver i can start to 
torture test integrator with sample usages :).","2002-11-06","55"

the event system. any object can 
register to listen to any other object (basically) - however 
that object may only understand what to do with a few of those

moved from the red area, to the yellow, then to the green. 0.6.0 
will not appear until either everything in 0.5.0 section is in the 
green OR something causes us to move items holding us back into a 
later release section Jason Cater liked 
KDE's release plans better than the 
traditional roadmap you see w/projects as it is more fluid -

said that Forms would be better at doing dynamic forms, as it 
would be aware of what font sizes and screen size it was 
working to. Jason said actually, no 
forms definitions ever mention point sizes or anything like 
that - that was up to the UI (user interface) driver.","2002-11-07","55"
"1886","803","4","Derek said this might be as simple as just tweaking the 
current Simple Form Wizard in Designer to produce its GNUe Forms 
Definition (.gfd) as an XML stream instead of a file, and passing 
this to Forms - i think thats a plus 
of dealing with xml in this case is forms shoudnt care if the 
definition is coming from a file or directly from a stream.
Jason pointed out that it doesn't fit 
in with any model of forms client we have... the client is always 
given a definition. Derek said that, in practice, he 
would probably expect some other tool (possibly GNUe Common) to 
prebuild streams and hand it to 
forms. By putting the dynamic form generator in Common, 
any GNUe tool could use it - you 
coudl have a form that called a trigger to make a dynamic 
form - rofl that would be funny.","2002-11-07","55"

the last release. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
dcl has LOTS of new goodies - i 
just havent tested them all. I hope mdean is around as it might 
be this weekend - i had my side pretty much done - he was fixing 
new nested product stuff. Jeff asked 
What's your integration plan with DCL 
and the rest of GNUe? Derek said 
for right now, my goals are to get 
it doing some stuff to help with managing consulting operations 
and gnue - then start migrating it to gnue - it already uses GNUe 
Schema Definitions. Also, my 
production implementation uses GNUe Reports - i will likely author 
some reports for it with GNUe Reports and put themin the DCL 
distro. There are several gfd's for it. Jeff said he 
would do a revised version of the Debian packages for DCL or 
any of the GNUe Tools whenever he was told there were enough 
new features to make it worthwhile.","2002-11-08","55"
"1888","805","1","Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vart) asked what 
is master and detail when we talk about blocks in form? 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said master/detail 
is parent/child, giving the classic example of invoices and 
invoice item lines. Dmitry asked shouls 
i put child block inside parent? <block name=""parent"">
<block name=""child""></block></block>
Derek said he normally put the blocks after each other. 
Jason Cater (jcater) confirmed blocks aren't 
meant to be nested - I really don't know what would happen - but I 
wouldn't recommend trying :) Dmitry asked 
how blocks will know they related? by 
datasources assigned to them? Derek said you used the 
masterlink="""" and detaillink="""" attributes on the datasource tag to 
define the linked (master and detail) fields. He thought 
you can define parent child stuff in 
the blocks as well, but i havent done it that way. Jason 
said that was depreciated since 0.0.x 
series.","2002-11-08","55"
"1889","805","2","Dmitry said he had been trying to do master-detail using triggers. 
Jason said you don't really have to use many

agreed - forms internals does most DATA 
work.","2002-11-08","55"

Windows yet. Bajusz Tamás (btami) said it worked quite well - 
using the GTK2 driver for GNUe Forms on Windows worked better 
than the wx driver - it isn't full 
featured IIRC - but hasn't got that ugly bugs like ""focus 
nightmare"" and ""tabbed pages"" problems. James Thompson 
(jamest) asked how hard is it to 
get the gtk2 driver running on any platform? i thought it 
required custom patches to gtk or something - so avoided it 
for now. Bajusz said that, on Windows XP, he just had 
to downloaded the necessary stuff 
from sourceforge - and it worked - no need for cygwin.","2002-11-10","55"
"1892","808","1","Bajusz Tamás (btami) reported a 
problem with pages and blocks - i have 1 table with many fields, and 
want use tabbed pages, but with only one datasource and one 
block. James Thompson (jamest) said that the code assumed 
a block would not spread across multiple pages. This limitation
had been inspired by similar functionality in equivalent 
proprietrary products - have fields 
display across pages is in the forms TODO - the blocks nested 
inside pages have been around since the start - I'm not saying 
were tied to that idea only that is was the 1st implementation 
and we've never adjusted it :) This would probably 
not change until they provided a way to repeat fields across 
different pages - What we want to 
provide is a way to say this field belongs on all pages, or on 
pages 1, 3 and 5, or on page 1 - however I wouldn't expect this 
feature until after 0.5.x series is complete. Bajusz 
said his problem was more immediate - 
what to do if i have 1 table 
with 100 fields and want tu use 1 form. James admitted 
right now you're going to suffer 
:) - he never thought about 
that size table when I did the page inside block thing. 
For a very nasty workaround 
he suggested make a 
master/detail/detail/detail setup - all using the same 
table. However, It 
would be ugly to setup, editing would be a major pita.

you?","2002-11-10","55"

they changed the API or have a serious bug. Jeff tried 
anyway, and asked Is there a good way 
to make the input boxes more than 0 pixels wide? - the 
wizard was setting them with a default width of minus 5. 
James Thompson (jamest) said the 
default size is based upon the size reported by the

Derek Neighbors (revDeke) felt these belonged in CVS, in the

that every feature needs an

as for learning. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
I want to rm -rf samples and start all 
over. I want one interesting 
schema with sample data and all - and all forms / reports / etc

Derek said it had a very simple schema - 
one main table and a few foreign

PG-13. Alternatively, ideal 
for me would be a music database - CDs parent - Songs Child - 
lots of lookup tables for year put out, label etc. 
This would also demonstrate some 
cool triggers as i want to tie it into CDDB :). Jan 
wondered if a sample application for 
gnue should have connections with business. Jason was
not sure I agree because a sample with 
a pure business theme will tend to try to outgrow itself and try 
to become an actual app. Derek said he would come up 
with a schema in .gsd (GNUe Schema Definition) format over the 
next few weeks.","2002-11-11","55"

Reports with i18n (internationalisation) Bajusz Tamás (btami) 
said it seems something puts 
charset=UTF-8 into html header. Jason Cater (jcater) 
volunteered if someone can whip me 
up a simple report that fails with i18n, I can debug. 
Bajusz said it seemed to be any 
report that pulls db data not in ascii, i suppose - you use 
dest.write ('<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""ISO-8859-1""?>\n') 
in GRReport.py. Jason thought 
there's more to it than just changing 
that header, though - I think I have to open a codec - which I 
learned to do this past weekend by accident. Bajusz 
said you don't have to deal with 
codecs, if sitecustomize.py was set up to set all 
locales. Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) believed that Arturas Kriukovas
(Arturas) had got it working without having to do this, but 
he was not sure of the details. Later, he found Arturas' commit 
message - Corrected problem of i18n 
characters in .gfd file - in case of not only ascii characters, 
sax returned unicode string, which caused further errors in 
python. Earlier this was solved by changing system-wide site.py 
file option defaultencoding from 'ascii' to other value. Now
encoding is read from gnue.conf file option formFontEncoding and 
is used to enforce sax returned unicode string recode to given 
encoding. Bajusz said that this 
solves the gfd's problem, but what 
about data (from DBMS) ? Dmitry said that his 
problem was that xml processing 
enforces internal representation in unicode - it is not with db 
data - you know db encoding and can convert to other encoding if 
you wish. Bajusz said he was 
thinking about reports - it makes an 
intermadiate xml file with dest.write() calls - and then a 
sablotron process comes. I don't know/when how UTF-8 comes 
into the process. Dmitry said that UTF 
comes as far as you use xml processing libs (parsers).","2002-11-12","55"

gnue-sb handle european tax stuff - ie tax on sales? Derek
said right now this is my big pain - im 
torn whether to make gnue-sb US only - or support foreign stuff. The 
problem i have with making it 'anywhere' is you lose a TON of validation 
rules US business love and speed features. Like if US only i can make it 
so you enter a zipcode and it auto populates city and state - i can 
validate phone numbers against states i.e. is that a valid area code for 
a state etc etc. As soon as i make it i18n i end up with very sloppy 
validation and very general data entry. /me realizes there is a huge 
foreign market and doesnt want to discount that. 
if lots of non us people are willing to 
help and use likely i will make it i18n - if not then i will likely 
make US centric as thats my target market. Christian said 
i think having a market at all is better 
than fulfilling thousand problematic and inconsistent wishes - if the 
resources aren't sufficient, we can still fork. Currently i just don't 
have an enterprise customer who wants to make a switch :( - so i don't 
have big ERP reality touch :-((","2002-11-13","56"

its an XML markup for database 
definition. It was not necessary for building an application, 
but it is useful for transferring data 
from one database to another - or filling a database with 
tables/data. Bill Gribble (grib) explained 
if you define the database structure 
with XML, you can translate it into idiomatic SQL for a 
specific database variety. Bajusz said 
you can find a good example in zipcode 
sample - in samples/tutorials/forms/zipcode.gsd - and there is 
an ooO doc around, but i can't recall where :).","2002-11-13","56"

there like a standard XML database dump format? Like if Iwere 
to export all the contents of a database into an XML file

would just imagine that you'd give each field name to an element 
and dump. XML is really bad for representing databases, though.
You'd have to dump a Schema at the same time to give you 
characteristics of each field. And XML implies that order is 
important. Nick felt this was a 
normal overly-complicated xml solution. Jeff disagreed - 
It's exactly the right level of 
complexity. The problem with tab or CSV is that it's lossy.
You lose the details that you've asked for about structural 
requirements in the cell. If you didn't care about that, then tab 
delimited is probably a better choice anyway.  It's easier to parse.
The other two cases where using XML is worthwhile is:
1) Occasional Binary data, or data that uses the intended 
separators. 2) Where you want to remove the relationships and 
build up complete records using XSLT.","2002-11-13","56"

short question about GSD.
Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) asked can

He explained we are moving away from 
xslt to a large degree - certainly it will be supported if someone 
wants to maintain it. Jan thought 
that xslt was just the option for all the guys who want to have GSD 
but don't want to use python. Jason explained 
GSD is still a standard markup in 
XML - no more no less - and we didn't want 
gnue-common as a requirement, not necessarily python - even though, 
to get it working quickly, I am using gnue-common - but that can be 
removed later on, allowing people to use sablotron or any
other XML processor to parse .gsd files.","2002-11-13","56"
"1918","823","4","Jan, referring back to 
, 
said his main concern was why did you 
decided to make GSD using less datatypes. Jason said 
it was never intended to support 
as many as it had - somewhere along the 
line it got goat-raped and all those things added. 
Derek Neighbors (derek) said that the original schema abstraction 
from DCL which had inspired .gsd had 
one or two more than we have now - but what wsa in cvs got trashed
- i.e. lots of datatypes added and support in designer broke - 
i was in a pinch so discussed with jcater and we documented and 
revamped back to original vision. I went to make new style sheets 
for XSLT and decided they were more cumbersome to maintain than a 
program - so we are making a program. Certainly any XSLT stud could 
come and modify the XSL to make it a viable alternative - 
not only do we encourage it, we hope it happens - GNUe is about 
choice after all. As for tying to common, im not wholly against 
that as with XSLT one can break that dependency.
Jason said our first priority has to 
be our tools - I want to design stuff that other projects can 
use - e.g., formats, etc - but that doesn't mean I can put that 
objective ahead of it being usable for GNUe. Jan agreed. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) felt it's like 
the appserver for dotGNU issue - 
we won;t discourage it but we won;t 
compromise making AppServer the best possible business application 
server for our purposes.","2002-11-13","56"
"1919","823","5","Jan said I just have two 
concerns: 1. how abstract will GSD be? I.e. will it still 
be usable for appserver? 2. what about gsd->sql generation 
in dbdriver and gsd->sql driver in scripter. Jason said 
we wanted GSD to be abstract - not to 
be an XML version of postgres sql with some translators for other 
dbs. On the second point, he noted that the 
scripter is in common - so the dbdrivers 
can certainly use it - eventually, 
a dbdriver can take a schema def and actually create the underlying 
tables - schema scripter (the scripts in debate here) create SQL 
statements - so the dbdrivers could just call scripter to get the 
SQL statements to run. Once again, though, in the scheme of things, 
is not a huge priority. Jan asked if this meant that 
the scripter would replace the schema 
writing code which is allready in dbdriver. Jason said 
that all there was at the moment was a dictionary to give the 
correct syntax/equivalent to CREATE table for each supported 
database. Jan asked about the code in 
common/src/dbdriver/_dbsig/DBdriver.py: _buildTableDefinition 
etc. Jason said imho this is 
putting a lot of stuff in dataobjects - I was hoping they wouldn;t 
get too much more complex.","2002-11-13","56"

The next day, 
Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vcat) asked what 
gcvs is for? Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) explained 
it wraps common - so say you write 
a script myfoo.py that usues common - instead of having to set 
python paths you can just do gcvs myfoo.py.
This was especially useful as of time of writing
since the gsd converter uses common 
but isnt a real script as of yet - gcvs Scripter.py 
mycool.gsd postgresql > newpsql.sql.","2002-11-13","56"
"1921","823","7","Later, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) reported a possible bug in the 
GNUe Schema Definition import code - you had to include a 
<table name=""table_name""> tag to identify which table 
to create, but if the table specified did match that of 
the table to import, then the script failed silently.
ie the import 'name' must match 
the table 'name' or the .sql doesnt get created, but no errors 
are generated. I'm not sure if you meant it to force a name 
match or not - if not its a bug - if so, we need an error 
message saying the .sql isnt created. Jason said that 
was definantly a bug - the parser should 
bomb off with an error. 
He fixed this and committed it to CVS.","2002-11-13","56"
"1922","824","1","Bill Gribble (grib) asked are 
there any plans to provide a gnue transaction processing 
server, or queueing system?  or are most gnue apps tied to

there are plans for this in the 
appserver, as discussed in

how this could used in situations that needed accurate 
positioning, such as printing an invoice on a pre-printed form.
James Thompson (jamest) said gnues 
reporting tool outputs an XML markup that can be converted to 
text, html, ps, pdf, whatever - I've had people write letters 
in word processor of their choice - save as PS file via windows 
apple laserwriter - then reports can merge data in. Sent out 
about 600 faxes this way a few months back.","2002-11-13","56"
"1924","826","1","James Thompson (jamest) warned that our 
win32 support in GNUe Forms via wxPython has issues, we're 
writting a win32 API ui driver during the next release cycle 
because we can't get what we need from wx - it works, but it's a 
bit odd. Bill Gribble (grib) asked 
so is wx not quite the x-platform 
miracle it was thought to be? James said 
i think it's the underlying widget 
set for the platform - on X we can get ahold of certain events, 
in windows those events never make it to the wx level. 
Bill asked is gtk on win32 too far 
from usability? James said he had not had time to 
investigate this properly yet - but 
my understanding is that the gtk2 client is missing some features 
but is moving along nicely - 
we're getting lots of win32 patches 
it seems and gtk2 patches so it may work better than I 
think.","2002-11-13","56"
"1925","826","2","Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
i think wx is pretty good xplatform 
if you have limited resources (i.e. better than anything else) - 
however its not perfect. I think it has done us well... i.e. quick 
xplatform to get people interested and get us supported with little 
effort - now that we have a bigger base i think it will be nice to 
see naitve, win32, gtk, qt. James said he had added a 
native win32api Forms UI to the feature plan. Derek said 
yeah i noticed :) - i think its a good 
change - i think you are sick 
for being eager to write one, but its a good thing(tm) ;). 
James said he wanted to rework the gfd 
format to seperate layout from logic - btami asked for a feature 
that would be easy once seperated - so i spoke w/ jcater about it. 
We decided that the forms documentation wouldn't be that good if we 
changed the file format right after we release the docs :)
He was also writting a GNUe Common usage 
guide that shows you how to write non-gnue apps with common - should 
make it into 0.4.1.","2002-11-13","56"
"1926","826","3","
The next day, Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) asked what the plans were 
to circumvent the problems with wx under Mircrosoft Windows. 
James said i know works being done on 
gtk2 driver which works under windows.....however what I believe you 
will see in the next major upgrade is a UIdriver based upon win32all - 
my understanding it that is exposes the win32 api directly which will 
make for a painfull coding experience but should result in us getting 
exactly what we require. I have not looked into this really closely 
yet though (my last copy of the win api book covers the ""new"" api in 
win 3.1) :) There were no plans to drop wx in favour of GTK2. 
He explained that the UI (user interface) drivers were abstracted 
from the main Forms code - there were already uidrivers for curses, 
gtk2 and wx - a win32 UIdriver.py could be slotted in the same way. 
the idea is we don't want coders to have 
to learn the internals of forms to add a driver - well, not all the 
internals - they just have to provide code to deal with the events 
that are passed into a driver. Much of GNUe was designed 
to be pluggable in this way - our database 
drivers work the same way and designer 
also has plug-in system to extend it's capabilities.","2002-11-13","56"
"1927","826","4","Keith asked can curses work on DOS ? 
Jason said he had looked at curses + DOS - 
went into ""python"" on a win32 machine - and did ""import curses"" - and 
it didn't work. James was not too 
worried about text on windows though - personally, i saw the curses 
thing as usefull for someone running text terminals. Keith 
noted that there are some companies working 
with accounting software that runs on DOS. James agreed -
i know text apps are used alot in the real 
world - i myself don't think gui == good by default - however i think a 
dos text client would be a huge investment in time. Now if a person 
could find a python module for manipulating text then it would be 
possible - but doing from scratch would be painful. Jason 
understood you can get curses libraries 
for win32/dos machines - so you'd probabl;y be able to custom compile 
a python binary - I don't have the time to invest in that route but I 
imagine it's doable. James noted 
ooooo, if we can get a python binary that 
does that then our existing packaging will just work.","2002-11-13","56"
"1928","826","5","James acknowledged that win32 support 
is a big issue - that combined with the desire to work on layout caused 
us to adjust our 
feature 
plans. Jason agreed I think a win32 
client will come along very quickly once its started. In the 
meantime, James suggested setup a cheap arse 
""server"" running the curses client accessing this via telnet 
w/ putty on the win boxes. It may sound 
sick but when I go places I spend time looking at their 
computer interfaces (at stores, companies, etc) - i always ask myself 
""can forms do that?"" - he saw similar set-ups to this a lot - 
which always strikes me as funny - to spend 
XX dollars on a windows license to run as a glorified vt320.","2002-11-13","56"
"1929","826","6","Later, James tracked down a 
web
reference to a text-based client - it's 
not curses but at quick glance it looks like it would provide enough 
features to make such a driver possible. Derek Neighbors 
(revDeke) shudders at wincurses - 
i think your idea of vt100 putty connections to GNUe Server would be 
more effective :) Jason noted that 
looks so close to the underlying curses driver that I bet it could 
be grafted in - so the ""widget set"" we have created to go over 
curses could also be used over wcon. He was not sure how it 
worked however - was it really a DOS screen, or a Win32 console?
James felt anyone running pure dos solution 
would probably be more open to other setups - unless legacy app forced 
them into it. Jason agreed - if they 
are in a dos setup we talk them into putting in an ltsp server - 
and make the dos machines LTSP ""telnet"" clients :).","2002-11-13","56"
"1930","827","1","J Mozeleski (imoz) asked what ERP backgrounds the GNUe core 
developers had - whether it was mainly J-BOPS 
(JD Edwards/Baan/Oracle/Peoplesoft/SAP 
high end ERP background). James Thompson (jamest) said they had 
a little of everything, my experiece 
is with a home grown erp at a mfg plant using oracle and their old 
sql*tools. GNUe Forms is somewhat based upon the way Oracle SQL*Forms 
worked - as both myself and jcater like that tool, however we've 
altered things we hated about it. J Mozeleski said his 
background was more middle-market, including working 
for a Great Plains VAR writing custom 
enhancements for clients. He had been thinking about 
an open source mid-market solution
but after finding Gnue 
I'm thinking instead of creating something from scratch I could use 
your toolset to do this?  Except I would have to learn Python 
:-). James said sorta - 
our trigger system currently only supports python - but quite a bit 
can be done via designer w/o writting any triggers. Even learning 
python you'd only have to learn a small part of it - we have a doc 
in cvs that give a little tutorial on it too - should be in the 
next release due out any day now.","2002-11-13","56"
"1931","827","2","J Mozeleski noted that Great Plains works 
virtually identical to this.  They have a custom scripting language 
called Dexterity and a similar forms designer, etc. Same concept 
of triggers, etc. Of course then they got bought by M$ and are now 
porting to .NET... Also, as proprietary software, 
you have to buy a very expensive site 
license to use the modified code and only dealers get access to 
the Dexterity tools..","2002-11-13","56"

Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said i 
suppose there should be 3 ways (at least to do schema introspection 
on csv) - one is the header row(s) define the 'table' - two is a

"1933","828","2","Later, Matt Rice (ratmice) asked why a sample form definition

a staticset is just that, static - 
it isn't updated by a form. Matt said he really needed a 
dynamic set, but wanted something he could use offline. 
Jan Ischebeck (siesel) suggested you 
can use sqllite for that. Jason suggested 
if you really wanted something even simpler 
than sqlite - you could use csv files - /me shudders at the thought 
of doing that with forms - but you could. Andrew confirmed 
that his code defined a class for a CSV_DataObject that was a

"1934","829","1","Further to 
, 
Bajusz Tamás said i have a dilemma - 
1. use sitecuspomize.py for setdefaultencoding() - 2. use 
encoding in every place where it needed - i myself used 1. 
before ,and i was happy - but today i remowed my sitecustomize.py
to test for release and got errors from several places. 
James Thompson (jamest) asked are you 
saying we need a way to modify sitecustomize.py during 
setup? Bajusz was not sure, as Arturas Kriukovas (Arturas) 
has raised concerns about how this would affect other python 
applications on the same machine. Jason Cater (jcater) said 
in production environments, we will 
probably have a ""custom"" python install in which it wouldn't make 
a difference. I don't know what else to do though - without changing 
all file open() commands to a codec.open(file, encoding='unicode') - 
which will suck. James did not 
think a small alteration to the file 
(prompted for of course) is that big an issue. Bajusz
said if we can use our sitecustomize.py 
with setdefaultencoding() - then no need for many 
*.encode(encoding) - and python do the rest. The remaining problem, 
how an install process gets the correct encoding - maybe a popup 
like in a debian install? James said 
i think it'd have to be - as this is 
different from the locale setting isn't it? Bajusz said 
yes - his own locale was hu_HU (for Hungarian/Hungary) but his 
encoding in python is iso8859-2 or 
cp1250 - python can grab 
encoding from XP/2000 and from LC_ALL in *nix. Jason 
asked if this was the default behaviour. Bajusz said that this 
was his custom install - no 
sitecustomize.py exist per default. Jason felt 
I really hate that you can't change 
encoding in your app - that is a really bizarre design decision 
for python to make :(.","2002-11-13","56"
"1935","829","2","
Two days later,
James Thompson (jamest) asked how well GNUe was working in 
Microsoft Windows for Bajusz. Bajusz said that he had not 
put site.py/sitecustomize.py into 
the McMillan packages (used to create stand-alone *.exe files for 
python applications in Microsoft Windows - 
so i tend to use encodings thing 
:(. Forms and Designer themselves were reasonably stable, 
but there were a significant number of 
event issues which he had raised 
as collected win32 bugs in DCL :). 
He had also failed with making forms/reports 
with simple wizard if i used non ascii title - when i want to save 
them. James said he needed to move the formFontEncoding 
code from Forms into Common. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
what outside of forms will use it?
James asked wasn't designer going to 
support all languages in its menus/dialgos?.","2002-11-13","56"
"1936","829","3","Bajusz reported huh, finally i 
reproduced my error :) in Reports. It appeared to be 
treating the %s paramter literally as an invalid XML tag, rather 
than replacing it with the value of the paramter - this was 
without sitecustomize.py. 
James was surprised it's really 
putting the %s in there? Jason suggested putting a 
print statement in to print some relevant variable values. 
Bajusz said that the debugging print statement itself then 
errored out - UnicodeError: ASCII 
encoding error: ordinal not in range(128) - python always 
wants to convert unicode strings into ascii. This 
was not normally a problem cose 
python is clever - but it allways uses unicode in XML. 
Bajusz realised that Arturas' patch to Reports was not 
ideal, as it used FontEncoding code originally meant for 
Forms - but as jamest said, a simple 
fontEncoding in [common] is a solution. Jason felt that 
fileEncoding? or textEncoding
would be a better name, as fonts per se were not the issue. 
James asked did we ever get a 
global section working in config file? to be able to 
set options like this for all the tools - 
/me thinks he worked on a [default] 
section. Bajusz wondered what if 
someone wants to use different lang for forms and for 
reports.","2002-11-13","56"
"1937","829","4","Dmitry said he had a mail from

based on CVS, had been designated 0.4.1a and 
0.4.1 is lexically a lower version

Bajusz confirmed that the setup.exes included GNUe Reports as well, 
now that this had reached version 0.1.0. The main reason that the

all by itself, rather than the database drivers.","2002-11-13","56"
"1949","831","1","Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said he might need to do a 
few point releases of 0.4.x, depending on how long James and Jason 
took to do 0.5.0. James Thompson (jamest) said 
most of 0.5.0 
shouldn't be major, we've been looking into it - it'll be major on the 
user visible side of things, but internals shouldn't kill us. 
Derek was thinking the win32 driver and 
curses drivers will be the biggies - not necessarily in 'dev' time but 
in testing time - assuming basic curses support didnt make it into 
0.4.1. James said i'm pretty sure 
it will be _almost_ feature complete for 0.4.1 - but I haven't tested 
in a few days. Derek was impressed - i 
dont think it needs to be 'complete' for 0.4.1 just like i dont think win32 
would need to be complete for 0.5.0 - but more 'reasonably' complete 
'first preview' give us lots of feedback :)","2002-11-14","56"
"1950","831","2","James said 
i imagine 0.5.0 will have the new gfd format 
and maybe the start of win32 - the new gfd format will be a HUGE gain 
for forms - as you'll be able to do l33t things in it due to 
the complete seperation of layout from 
logic - you'll be able to mirror 
fields on multiple pages, mix things about any way you like. I think 
0.5.0 is this year - it's become an itch we've got to scratch - you 
should get a layout manager system as well. Keith Jagrs (KeithJagrs) 
noted there's only one month and a half left to new 
year's eve. Jason Cater (jcater) said our 
history is to release either right before or on a major holiday. 
Derek agreed - well 0.5.0 before end of Q4 
02 would be great - while there are lots of holidays generally that means 
time off work - which means to a degree gnue time :) He was 
worried about this gfd switch - will we 
have conversion tools? or open in design and save - /me is only worried 
as im getting ready to do a boat load of forms. James said 
yes - I think we're pretty good about 
changing things and hiding it - it's 
worth it in any case - this is something I wanted from day 1 - 
it's how sql*forms from oracle did it. 
Jason said jamest and I were discussing and 
decided we really couldn't wait any longer - as the closer to 1.0 we get, 
the more stable the gfd format must be - so if we are going to do a 
""correction"" in our format - we better get it on!. Also, 
James pointed out that they were planning much more documentation 
with the 0.5.0 releases, so would rather change the format before 
documenting it rather than after! He had always wanted to 
seperate the logic from the layout in 
gfd - when I started I wanted something out the door fast - so I blended 
them which was a bad, bad thing - but it was quick, i was just learning 
python while coding, i was young and needed the money. 
Nick Rusnov (nick) sympathised - we've all been 
domn that route - but you end up just spending all your money on gold 
chains and skintight pants.","2002-11-14","56"

I will quite literally be able to do a converter to get

better than sql*forms for many reasons James said 
we are better now in many respects.

emphasised that it was up to James and Jason, as the main 
coders, to decide which version a feature belonged to -
i.e. you could say we will never 
support that, we will support it after 1.0 sometime or yeah we

"1953","831","5","Derek asked what is grid view 
mode? James explained it 
converts a std form to look like 
pgaccess - it's a 'shut up users that keep asking for pgaccess 
on my systems even though pgaccess is slow and buggy' 
feature Derek asked about a a 
native grid widget to replace the current rows=""10"" 
functionality, as discussed previously in many threads, as far 
back as . 
He realised this was mostly cosmetic, but 
again this is high priority it 
could be post 1.0 - but thats what im asking ... should it be pre 
1.0 and if so, how pre 1.0 - im thinking the blocks/fields things 
might make it easier to implement. He also questioned 
the need for a qt driver pre 
1.0 - ideally he would like to find a volunteer from 
outside the core developers to write this 
like happened with gtk2 one -
i.e. i would like to see a qt driver - just hate to see critical 
resources on it, again i understand the scratch an itch so its 
comment not a complaint.","2002-11-14","56"

was questions for designer, but looks like its plan isnt produced 
yet. The three things i have there 

good mask editor
starting of schema editor
trigger editor capabilities
cvs integration
project capabilities
gpd editor

- schema and gpd (GNUe Process Definition - the file format 
for Navigator) editor are becoming a 
big weakness i see as i am starting to write applications. 
project capabilities and trigger 
editor would be nice but i can hobble ok w/o - mask editor and cvs 
integration would be gravy :) - also a 
reports design capability.","2002-11-14","56"
"1955","831","7","Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said a 
good mask editor could have a set of preset masks to use. 
Jason said there was already some functionality for this, but it 
needed some more polish. The way it worked at the moment was that 
you defined a format in the gnue.conf file, and could then 
reference it from GNUe Forms Definitions (.gfd).","2002-11-14","56"
"1956","831","8","Derek also asked 
for a calendar picker for 
date format fields - i think about 
every platform can support as well - i see it as nothing mroe 
than attribute of entry of some kind. James was not sure 
of the need. Derek gave a practical example - 
im planning airline travel - i want 
to travel week of christmas - i want ot leave monday before christmas
and return friday after christmas - do you know those dates w/o 
looking at a calendar? unfortunately i dont - its much easier for 
the application to show me a calendar than to hunt one down 
:( Andrew asked hmm, when was 
wxCalendarCtrl added to wxpython? is it in 2.2.x ? :) 
Derek agreed  it was not a high priority 
thing - it was one of those ithink we need, could be post 1.0 pre 
1.0 thats your call. James wondered if this would be better 
done as a plug-in. Derek felt this was pretty core, but 
im not opposed to abstracting it so 
that other things can be done as well - i.e. i realize there will be 
lots of similar requests some we agree with some we dont.","2002-11-14","56"
"1957","831","9","Andrew, after carefully donning a 
flameproof suit asked 
what sort of timeframe are we 
estimating for these releases? :) Derek said 
there was talk about trying to have 
0.5.0 by end of december early january if real life (tm) treats 
everyone well - i think predicating anything beyond that for other 
releases makes little sense.","2002-11-14","56"
"1958","832","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) was finishing 
the merge to include all the changes to GNUe's CVS in 
Papo's CVS. but I want to be sure we 
didn't break anything. should I use the samples to test, and that 
would be enough, or are better test somewhere else? 
James Thompson (jamest) said i think the 
samples are fine - once you've merged can you get us a list of 
differences between your code and ours.","2002-11-14","56"
"1959","832","2","Later, Marcos noted that almost all the 
DBdirver.py's have the same $driver_DataObject_Object._buildQuery 
method - they're all the same (ok, just the first few ones). 
Derek Neighbors (derek) commented good 
eyesight you have young jedi. Marcos suggested 
why not move it to DBSIG_DataObject_Object 
or above? Jason Cater (jcater) said if 
you look closer, they can't be moved up - this is forcing the DO to not run 
the parent's DO, but a second parent's one - 
/me remembers hating to do that, but it was 
necessary. Marcos noted he had to change this in each of the 
16 database drivers.","2002-11-14","56"
"1960","832","3","
Some days later, 
Marcos asked what would 
be that 'kstructural changes'that you tal about in (one of) your last 
commit? Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) speculated 
evil doings :), mainly the 
seperation of logic and layout, 
as discussed in . This made it even 
urgent to merge our trees (i had hoped 
you would have merged for 0.4.1 release) - but if you guys dont hop on 
it in next day or two it will likely be really BAD - i.e. the guts will 
change significantly and merging will be near impossible. 
Marcos said I can send the big patch 
*now*. James asked 
does it have to be one huge patch? 
Marcos said he could (try to) separate it in 
functional patches but that would take some time. James said to 
send it anyway. Marcos disclaimed some features 
added are maybe deprecated. those you think are ugly, pleasse feel fre 
to discuss them either in your mailing list or in ours. Marcos 
sent the main large patch as a single 143k diff file to James for 
review.","2002-11-14","56"
"1961","832","4","
The next day, Marcos noted that the 
simplest of our patches had now been applied to the main 
GNUe code tree. James said he had some queries on the other 
parts of the patch. Marcos explained that 
genericBox is for asking questions with 
more options than 'yrs' and 'no', whilst 
atomic* is to make sure only one person 
can modify a what-would-be-called database register at a 
time. James asked could the same 
result be accomplished by adding an atomic="""" to the datasource 
tag? Marcos said it was more subtle that that - by applying it 
to an individual entry, only that entry must 
be atromic. the others may not be midified atomically. 
This was called from a trigger - he pasted an example.
James explained the reason I ask this is 
that we want datasources to support record locking which this appears 
to be - if we were to add a atomic or locking="""" attribute to a 
datasource that locked records after they were modified - would that 
serve the same purpose? and I think it may require less work on the 
trigger writters part :).","2002-11-14","56"
"1962","832","5","Earlier, James noted that 
function calls in python are a hideous 
performance hit - we switched from a getFoo() to self._foo with the 
_ meaning private. They had not realised this at first 
either! Later, John Lenton (Chipaca) said 
how is less than 10% a 
major performance hit? or, how is less than 10% reason enough to 
through the whole OO thing out the window? James 
said that 10% isn't much on 
occasional calls but our UI system had lots of such things going 
on. Jason felt that 
self._form is as much OO as 
self.getForm() - just maybe not by the java definition. 
John said I have no problem wiht self.form, 
in fact, I kind of like it. It's the /^_/ that bothers us, as that 
is always an indication of ""this is private"" - and in fact you agree
- but then you expect people to call that, so it's no longer 
private. Jason said that the underscore prefix in code was used 
to indicated that something is considered 
to be a settable attribute - ala XML files. It was only 
in the context of the connections.conf config file that it meant 
""private."" James said i don't think we 
have a hardfast rule on private.","2002-11-14","56"
"1963","832","6","Earlier, James asked whether they had got scrollbars 
working with gridlayouts now?.
Marcos explained scrollbars associate to 
its surrounding block. - they 'register' to them - so, when the data 
source is updated, and the block is notified, the scrollbar gets 
updated too. what I can't make work is 'free scrolling'. wx is very 
ugly reporting these ind of events.","2002-11-14","56"
"1964","832","7","James also noted you exposed some gnue 
internals via some of those trigger functions - i was wondering why?
i know we did hacks like this at one time - but started to try to move 
away from them as internals can change and will alot :) So if we can 
figure out what is making you have to drop to internal levels we can 
adust the code - every time I've done this the workaround makes the 
triggers easier to maintain :) He was aiming to 
get a fair bit of this in for 0.4.2 but 
not all of it - as I'm pressed for time and have other bugzzz to 
address ;)","2002-11-14","56"
"1965","832","8","Marcos said I guess you're also puzzled 
by that history tables thing... Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said
i think your history tables need to be 
implemented as tables and triggers and not embedded in forms (read 
hardcoded) - i had same need for gnue-sb - was going to do all in 
triggers though there has been talk of making some 
'convience functions' for such things so triggers would be nice and 
clean. To save recoding the trigger for every field, 
you should be able to make it a shared 
trigger and just reuse it. Jason said that 
they had not wanted to use papo's solution as the general GNUe 
solution for transaction/history tables because 
we can't have harcoded schemas in 
common. Derek agreed - not 
everyone wants it - and HARDCODING it is not a solution. 
Marcos said we done it that way because 
appserver (what would like to use) was not available when we 
started coding things in a stable version. But he felt 
papo we can live with an external patch 
'till we recode, I gues....","2002-11-14","56"
"1966","832","9","Derek said that after this merge 
there will need to be some ground rules. He wanted to avoid 
papo having to maintain a seperate CVS, and would prefer patches 
function-by-function, rather than mega-patches like the current 
one. Marcos agreed - remember that the 
patch was sent 'as is', as I had no time to filter out what I 
thought it won't get anyways. Derek said 
we are willing to do what it takes 
to merge the repositories best we can - but we dont want 
'resyncing' to be a regular thing... we want one repository and 
patches :) Marcos, as the person responsible for 
re-syncing, was fully in agreement!","2002-11-14","56"
"1967","832","10","Later, John said We really, really 
need some way to tell when it's ok to go in and use 
the stuff and when we must write an accessor for it. 
Jason said if there's not an accessor 
now, then we didn't intend for it to have one. 
James said if it requires any type 
of logic at all to get what you require then you need an 
accessor.","2002-11-14","56"
"1968","832","11","Earlier, Derek emphasised that quibbles like this 
on papo's patch was not a rejection of the functionality - just some 
concerns over how it had been implemented. James agreed - 
dude, there's some cool stuff in that 
patch - I'm happy to see a 
working scrollbar setup for example, and 
you're menubar patches inspired jcater 
to add trigger to flip them off and on (I think). 
Also, the whole atomic* stuff has me 
seriously looking at replacing the TODO lock record here crap in 
datasources.","2002-11-14","56"
"1969","832","12","Earlier, Derek wondered if some of the issues with the patch were 
just a matter of personal coding style - like where to put braces or 
how much indentation to use. John asked about indentation. Jason said 
we are actually *very* standardized on 
indentation... any variancies are oddities that someone likely 
committed - we do two space indents, with no tabs - 
I don't think we want patches that do 
nothing but fix indentation levels - but that is what we try to 
code at. John said he would make this the standard for 
future papo patches.","2002-11-14","56"
"1970","832","13","Later, Jason asked what the new <entry 
style=""textlookup""> was for - it seemed to be just the 
sames a label. John explained textlookup _is_ 
a label, except that it goes and fetches the labelee in a dictionary 
table - rather like a cross between label and dropdown - the name 
might be less than perfect... but we couldn't find anything better 
:). James asked how large are the 
dictionaries this thing is pulling from ? John said 
it was typically used where doing a normal query would involve 
bringing back many rows of un-needed data. James agreed - 
if we did this via a normal datasource 
with prequery="""" and the result set it huge we kill memory (a 
shortcomming on our end) - but if 
we're scrolling thru a partlist and it's having to pull 
the values each time from the backend the UI would get choppy 
(a shortcomming of the way you've set it up, i think). 
However, our datasources already have a 
very stupid cache system built in which could help. 
Alternatively, this could easily be 
accomplished as a post-change trigger via the simpleQuery function 
(i think) or could we merge the 
concepts and use the datasources for now and concentrate on improving 
the cache system in datasources long term. Jason said that, 
for *this* particular case, the 
first way of doing it was the best although 
I do want to see cache system improvements.","2002-11-14","56"
"1971","832","14","Jason also suggested using the ""foreign key refresh"" 
functionality recently added for dropdowns, triggered by the 
on-change trigger. John asked how this would work. James 
suggested it'd be a style=label with 
the same attribs as a dropdown? John asked 
wouldn't that amount to overloading of 
label? - not that overloading was necessarily bad. 
James said this allows a uidriver that 
doesn't know how to deal w/ style=dropdown to still display a 
normal entry - such as the old, 
forgotten curses driver - it didn't do dropdowns but it did handle 
entries - our sample form had a dropdown where I could select Kansas 
in the dropdown - the text client let me type ks, degrading 
gracefully.","2002-11-14","56"
"1972","832","15","John said that another reason for not 
fetching everything is that these things might change between the 
first fetch and the time one wants to display them, so in effect you 
have to fetch it every time anyway. James agreed -
/me understands that you want the field 
to update if the backend data changes. John said 
this is taking one more step down the road 
of ""dropdowns need their own datasource"". Jason said this 
was the case anyway - all references to a 
database are done via a datasource - when you consider what all else 
datasources can do this opens up a lot of possibilities - e.g., with 
our static datasources - we can have combo boxes that pull from a 
static set of values defined within the form, not pulled from a 
table - that's just one example - remember we are abstracted from a 
relational database.","2002-11-14","56"
"1973","832","16","
The next day, James apologised for not getting more patches 
applied yet. Marcos was not worried - he said he had printed off 
James' comment about ""some cool stuff in that patch"" 
in big black letters -
we're gonna get that sheet of paper 
framed :).","2002-11-14","56"
"1974","833","1","Peter Sullivan (psu) said I have added a 
""Get 
Involved"" page to the website - mainly for 
a link to a good external article Jason Cater (jcater) 
wondered does it involve ""Send 
donuts""? Derek said we need a 
HOW DO I HELP PAGE - as that is number one question we get at 
info@gnue.org - hmmm this page might do the trick :). 
He asked for the contact address for documentation bugs/patches 
to be changed to docs-support@gnuenterprise.org rather than 
info@gnue.org, so they would feed directly into DCL via the 
e-mail gateway. The other thing we need 
if it doesnt exist is either a 'license page' or better yet right on 
the home page - add somethign that says gnue tools/packages are GPL
- as i know my pet peeve in getting new software is hunting down what 
license its under before downloading. We make lots of reference to 
freesoftware and even fsf, but i dont see clarification where we state 
we are GPL Peter agreed - most 
people should hopefully be able to guess that GNU* == GPL, but why not 
tell 'em outright? He would add it to the front page.","2002-11-14","56"
"1975","833","2","Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) suggested you 
may want to reassure people that using GNUe doesn't make their stuff 
GPL - as i've heard people worry about that before (interesting problem 
there). Derek said true... maybe 
point to gpl faq as well. Andrew asked 
applications that hook into GNUe common, 
what license would they fall under? Derek said 
if you used common via 'import type 
statements and such' i think your resulting application would need to 
be GPL - if you used it via RPC it could be anything you 
like as you were simply using rather than linking to the code.","2002-11-14","56"
"1976","834","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) suggested that the Debian packages 
should eventually be structured with a 
gnue-forms-base, with a 
seperate gnue-forms package for each user interface - 
gnue-forms-gtk2, gnue-forms-curses, 
gnue-forms-wx, gnue-forms-html etc, each with their 
own dependencies. Likewise, there could be a 
gnue-common-base and 
then seperate packages for each database driver - 
to give people finer grain control 
of the install. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) agreed -
I think that's the plan.
certainly for forms anyway. The hard part with doing it too much 
is that people will never figure out what to install.
Derek suggested couldnt we do 
something like task-gnue - for the people that dont want 
control.","2002-11-15","56"

item maintenance screen for GNUE-SB. He needed format masks, 
but according to the Developers' Documentation, it 
looks like masks arent quite there 
yet. He just committed the 
item_maint.gfd that actually manages the items - so item management 
is now officially in gnue-sb cvs - its basic but its a 
start.","2002-11-15","56"
"1978","835","2","Later, he said he had worked around not having format masks for 
the moment, but wondered where this fitted in the Feature Plans -

format/input masks - and documentation of masks :). 
Jason Cater (jcater) said input masks are 
a BIG todo - we are very close - but no cigar quite yet (that 
should be in 0.5.0 plans, if not, I'll add),

there.","2002-11-15","56"

need an easy way to do transaction stamping i.e. createdon/by, 
modifiedon/by. Jason Cater (jcater) said there was 
a REAL easy way to do transaction 
stamping - they're called Pre-Update and Pre-Insert triggers
- same principle as setting the sequence 
value on an insert. James Thompson (jamest) said 
no, we need a real, real way :) 
- just like the getSequence function, you 
also have getTimestamp.","2002-11-15","56"
"1980","836","2","Coincidentally, Derek then came up against a case where he 
needed to use getSequence - the classic
'the parent needs to create its id in order to store in the child' 
problem - do you have a sample form that this works in 
currently? Jason asked are they 
set up as master/detail? as it does all that behind the scenes if 
so. Otherwise, check the recipe's 
chapter in the dev guide.","2002-11-15","56"

The next day, Jason said we have 
a createdon recipe - but createdby - who is ""by"" ? 
James said i think he wants the 
username of the logged in user. Derek agreed - he
wasnt sure how to get that info 
via trigger. Jason said I 
know we can do that via triggers - but we probably need to add 
a convenience method. Derek asked 
what if you are using a custom 
'authenicator'? He had had 
to make all my 'transactional' stuff like that nullable for now 
in gnue-sb - until i get good trigger way to do it (or a 
convenience method) - then i will add it back in. /me thinks 
the date part is taken care of - if the db is setup properly
then the ""created on"" field should 
use function that posts timestamp if null else 
nothing if there - and the modified should use function that 
posts timestamp no matter what - though it would be better to 
amke it in application i think.","2002-11-15","56"
"1982","837","1","Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) said he was trying to get a 
form to work - like automagically 
inserting sequence numbers for master/detail. 
James Thompson (jamest) said that 
should be in the docs as a recipe IIRC. Andrew noted 
mysql's auto_increment doesn't 
work for master/detail, nor is it friendly :). James 
suggested i think if you implenet 
sequenceNumber in the mysql driver then you'd have them - i 
_think_. Andrew said all 
i want is for the primary key (id) to be set for each record 
:) - and the value being set to be visible to the detail 
portion. James said that's 
automatic on a commit in common - however getting the initial 
value from the db isn't IIRC - if you do the assignment on the 
database side then you have issues IIRC. He suggested 
a db side trigger or a default 
value set to a function. Andrew pointed out 
triggers? what's that? this is 
mysql i'm using :) James asked how the primary keys 
were being generated. Andrew said 
at the moment, i have the primary 
key field set to auto_increment in the db - which sucks.
James said hey! auto_increement == 
db side trigger! see, it's more advance than i give it 
credit. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
do you know the name of the sequence 
it created? Andrew did not think that sequences had 
names that could be referenced in mySQL. Jason went 
googling for the answer.","2002-11-16","56"

database.","2002-11-16","56"
"1984","837","3","Andrew suggested that it would probably 
be easier for me to get the current id value, increment it, and save it 
back - this would work with even simpler databases like sqlite

GNUe triggers to handle assigning the primary keys - 
create a table gnue_seed. Jason 
suggested that, or  select max(id)+1 from 
table; James added then make the 
getSequence in the db driver read the seed via a select for update, 
update it, then have it print to the debug log ""compensating for the 
lack of a sane database"". Andrew commented that he

2-minute thing with mysql, at most.","2002-11-16","56"

for Access for someone desperately trying to break their M$

we are not an access replacement, per 
se - but could definitely be a substitute - we are comparable 
to the Forms and Reports parts of access (only with a lot more 
power, imho) - we don't have a database, so you'd use PostgreSQL, 
for example, as the database backend (or SAP-DB, ....). 
On the programming side, he said we use 
Python for any triggers/events... it's a VERY newbie-friendly

the biggest thing we are missing (and

be nice to have that in designer(schema tools). If you all add the

what does transparentBlock attribute 
mean? Jason explained this controlled the behaviour of the 
tab key - If you are on the last field of a 
block and there is another block in the form then if transparentBlock 
is true a tab will take you to the next block - if false it will take 
you to the first field of the same block. Dmitry asked how you 
could get to the other notebook tab in this case. Jason said the Page

"1992","843","1","Nick Rusnov (nickr) asked theres no way 
to express in SQL the kind of uniqueness that says 'the combination 
of these two columns must be unique' is there? -
like a constraint but 
instead, this row is uniquified by two 
columns instead of just one. Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
isn't it just ""unique (field1, 
field2)"" James Thompson (jamest) agreed - 
you can create a unique index on 2 fields
or setup the primary key constraint at the end of the table def instead 
of behind one field. Jason noted that there was a distinction 
between unique and primary key - unique does 
not enforce nullness like primary key does - so if you want ""unique 
and not null"" you need to specify not null for those columns. 
He used multi-column unique constraints quite often - 
example, we sell magazines - so we have a 
table that holds our offers. it contains the magazine id and the number 
of issues - so only one combination of (magazine, issues) can exist in 
that table. there can be plenty of 12 
issue magazines - and plenty of offers for People magazine - but only 
one offer for People at 12 issues.","2002-11-17","56"

could be a lot of redundancy between gnue and wtisted. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said i think 
we existed long before twisted so one should ask why isnt 
twisted working with us :) - specifically they iirc are much more web 
oriented. Likely the appserver team would be the best to address 'twisted' 
stuff. Bill said seems like there's 
mission overlap but not enough to point a finger and say somebody's 
wasting time.  they don't handle any of the forms/reports/etc, just the 
wiring and app-service. Derek agreed - 
i think they are more similar to our 
appserver than gnue as a whole - i think jan or jcater mentioned offering 
an appserver provider for them or something. Bill said 
anyway their stuff looks pretty interesting.  
it is sort of kitchen-sinky and the code/doc ration is a little high but 
I think there's useful stuff.","2002-11-18","56"
"1994","845","1","John Lenton (Chipaca) asked why Derek Neighbors (revDeke) 
had started gnue-sb as a seperate project, rather than working 
with project papo. Derek said he had understood that papo was 
aimed specifically at the Argentinan market and was in Spanish. 
John explained the PAPO team's medium-term 
objective is to replace an Argentine-specific ERP. There is, as 
far as we know, nothing in the design of PAPO that's 
Argentina-specific - the screens are in spanish because that is 
_our_ target audience, but internationalisation was planned 
for after November. Derek said that when 
i looked at papo it wasnt what i was after - specifically you 
appeared to be making what we want final GNUe to be - 
with gnue-sb we plan to be much simpler 
than what official end game gnue would be - specifically there is no 
intention to use appserver with it - if you think we can work together 
great. John said that papo had been started as a seperate 
project, as the GNUe tools were mostly there, but the packages were 
a *long* way away of what we need. 
Derek agreed - that was why he had started gnue-sb.","2002-11-18","56"
"1995","845","2","John said that papo was pointed more 
towards small-to-medium organizations, while gnue (as it name implies) 
is aimed at fully fledged enterprise-level stuff, that is, IOHO, over 
papo's head - which is why gnue-sb called our attention... it seems to 
be more or less what papo is getting to be. Peter Sullivan 
(psu) said that some of the discussions about adding functionality 
to the Tools had indicated that papo has 
compatible but different way of approaching things - 
this wmight have been even worse on the Packages, and lead to a fork. 
He asked whether papo's long-term goals included AppServer. 
John said long term appserver is by far the 
cleaner approach, but there is nothing wrong with 2-tier if the needed 
functionality is hidden away in dbsig, for example. Peter 
felt that the overlap, if there was one, was between the GNUe Packages 
and papo rather than between gnue-sb and papo - but this had always 
been recognised. John felt there are some 
rough edges between what papo aims to do and what gnue seems to aim 
to do, mostly related to who the intended users are, but those are all 
confined to the UI AFAIR.","2002-11-18","56"

no problem working together. 
John said that papo's entity relationship diagram (ERD) 
tries to contamplate SB product mangling, but 
that's about it - he was going to set 
up a friendly web thingie to browse our ERD, 
as it is rather huge. He used Zot for ERD documentation, and

something that is usable and shippable and easily extensible -

startup. James Thompson (jamest) said 
you do that anyway in our 
system - the default is 10 records - set the datasource 
to prequery. Jason expanded 
our system only loads records 
as it needs them. James said that, to change the 
default, you just set the cache="""" attribute of the 
datasource tag. This interacted with the rows displayed 
on a form, so that if you 
have a entry on screen that has rows set to 15, 
it would load two lots of 13 records and display the

GNUe Forms for use with DCL for people who did not want to 
use the normal web-based front-end - 
note they are pretty ugly as 
they are created with a wizard in Designer, but they 
had required almost no

GNUe Form Definition (.gfd) files could soon be used on 
a curses interface - short of 
that i think we plan on making some 'email' clients - so that 
you can update things back and forth better via email - /me 
isnt really all that sold on it, but its do able - and the fsf 
would like such a thing. He did not see the 
justification for an emacs mode
for somethign that is not emacs like at ALL - an editor shouldnt 
be a project management application :) With current 
functionality, you could set up DCL to accept tickets via an 
e-mail gateway from any mail client, including emacs. He felt 
you might like request tracker 
better - i think its 
seriously lacking in features compared to dcl - but to some 
people emacs mode is more important than actually doing productive 
work :( He was not bagging 
on emacs... you can ask jcater its the first thing i install on 
a new machine - but emacs really is crappy for many things -

i saw some mailing list posts about what you're trying to do with acclite, 
and wanted to offer my assistance with code, or just giving you insight as to 
what I was thinking :) Peter Sullivan (psu) said that GNUe's 
involvement with Nola had started as just patching it, but they had ended up 
forking it as acclite, and were now looking at using it as the financials part 
of GNUe Small Business.","2002-11-23","57"
"2002","849","2","Ryan was no longer with Noguska, 
but though it was unlikely they would have accepted the patches anyway - 
the latest i heard was they were doing a complete rewrite 
of nola anyhow.  my guess is so they aren't bound by the gpl/other people's 
copyrights on the new version. Peter said it was generally accepted 
that submitting patches implied transferring the copyright to the owner of 
the patched code, but that there were some legal concerns about this. This 
was part of the reason GNUe asked all people submitting code to do a formal 
copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to avoid problems
later. Jason Cater (jcater) clarified that the 
Copyright Assignment, iirc, does not take any copyright rights away from the 
person writing the code - but it extends the rights to the FSF as well - 
so in essence, you are granting them the right to defend your 
code.","2002-11-23","57"
"2003","849","3","Later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said he had 
talked for sometime to a lady at noguska 
about the gpl and submitting patches to them - probably about the time you 
stopped working on nola. He explained 
long term we felt that we were better 
doing a fork - as it seemed as though it would be hard to get changes to 
happen going that route - and since we were not tied to php frontend much 
likely it would be cumbersome to maintain that. He was now
doing gnue-sb (gnue small business) which 
will be a gnue framework approach to the similar domain. 
He noted the other issue i had with nola was 
some dependencies/leaning towards print shop. Ryan said he did 
not know anything about GNUe forms, but intend to 
learn. Derek asked whether Ryan was 
looking to take nola and mold it from where 
it sits etc - is web frontend high priority to you etc? Ryan 
said i don't have any vision for it at the moment, 
except i'd like to see it integrated to the GNUe way of doing 
things.","2002-11-23","57"
"2004","849","4","Jason wondered why Nola had been written in php 
+ mysql in the first place. Ryan said MySQL had been chosen 
because a requirement was to run server cross platform, 
and be $$ free. Derek asked did anyone 
(clients) ever use nola? we tried to call noguska and ask for references 
that were using it at got nowhere - it seemed they considered it doa - 
and were using non free non web for most clients. Ryan said it had 
never been a priority product for Noguska - originally, 
they developed accounting (and print shop mgmt) in qbasic, dos based 
and Nola was intended to provide an upgrade path for this. He was 
not aware of it being 
heavily tested in production anywhere.","2002-11-23","57"
"2005","849","5","Derek said he had installed and 
configured Nola and messed with 
it, but had now started to go 
more from scratch witth gnue-sb - as it was easier than dissecting 
what was there (and i had no intentions to maintain the php web part) 
- so as soon as we decided we were not going to try to be nola 
compatiable upstream i started view it as a 'reference' instead  of 
a bsae - though for accounts receivable and payable and general ledger 
i might change my mind. Ryan asked what 
are your thoughts on the schema? do you think that'll stay mostly 
intact, or vastly different? Jason, 
as the person doing the initial research, 
said nola had one of the better schemas - 
we looked at sql-ledger as people raved about it but thought 
that Nola's looked more mature.","2002-11-23","57"
"2006","849","6","It was asked about looking at commercial applications' schemas, but 
Jason said no way we can do that - no way at 
all as schemas were copyright, and strongly protected by 
most commercial application vendors. For example, his own organisation
used Great Plains, but he will not even glimpse 
at it - as that's a conflict of interest big time. In any 
case, he thinks it's dangerous to just try to 
emulate a commercial package's schema and fields - even if you avoid 
any legal trouble - free software should aim to provide 
better functionality than similar proprietary systems.
For example, he recognised that Oracle SQL*Forms had influenced the 
initial design of GNUe Forms, but we are not, 
however, trying to do a duplicate - we 
do things differently than they do - some things very 
differently. it's like one's cooking 
style - if you grow up in a Southern kitchen and you start up your own

anyone eating at your restaurant can tell you were influenced by southern

me. =) He wanted a drop 
box list of my provinces, as defined in a tblProvinces 
table, to populate a foreign key field in a tblFoo. Derek Neighbors 
(derek) said you need to make a 
datasource for both tblFoo and tblProvinces - i.e. 2 separate 
datasources. Jeff said It looks 
like the wizard did that for me. Derek said 
then put an entry on your form
that belongs to tblFoo and is for field province_id - then go to 
property inspector for that entry - there would be three 
properties that needed to be filled in:


fk_datasource - the name of field in tblFoo that needed 
populating
fk_key - the name of the field in tblProvince that was the 
primary key of that table
fk_description - the name of the description field in the 
tblProvince table


He added you need not have a new 
form - i believe you can 
from schema editor drag the table to the form and it will 
autocreate the datasource for tblProvinces - then you just need 
to go to the province_id entry you originally had and put in 
those fk_* property values.","2002-11-25","57"

There was no need to install cygwin to run GNUe on Windows. . 
There was no native support for a Microsoft SQL Server database 
backend, but you could access it using the generic ODBC driver 
included in the setup.exe. Derek Neighbors (derek) confirmed this 
- if there was a native python driver available for MS SQL server,

other wise we must rely on odbc only.","2002-11-27","58"
"2010","853","1","Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked is there 
a master table of which widgets need to be provided by an UI, and 
which drivers support which ones? I'm trying to figure out what 
effort I would need to put in to never see wxpython (the 
python version of the multi-platform wx GUI toolkit, which was 
the default UI for GNUe Forms) again. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) agreed wxpython was not ideal - 
why do you think i've hacked on the 
gtk2 driver a little? Jeff said he would probably try to 
write some code for native win32 widgets. 
That would solve the problem nicely. The widget files don't look 
like they'd take more than a week or so to write. He was 
not sure I can usefully deploy this to 
end-users without doing something about the widget set. 
IT staff would put up with it.  I don't 
think people in other departments would. Stupid little things, 
like when you change a drop box, it doesn't update the 
drop box until you click on another box. Derek Neighbors 
(revDeke) believed 0.5.0 will have 
native win32. Jeff thought this was 
still wishlist-class. Derek noted that the 
feature
plan for Forms says 'start win32 
driver', but my understanding is they want to have a 'working' 
one for hard testing as of 0.5.0. drop down boxes are the BIGGEST 
evil in the wx on win32 - and its not fixable in wx.","2002-11-28","58"
"2011","853","2","Later, James Thompson (jamest) explained 
0.5.0 is all about gfd file changes
- at least that's what it's evolved into Derek agreed 
- i think it might be best to do gfd 
change only as 0.5.0 - and maybe get it out a little sooner than 
maybe first figured - and nto be shy to release 0.5.x's - that might 
have some 'features'. Jeff asked if there was a matrix 
showing what widgets each User Interface supported. James said 
i might be able to whip something up 
but I'll have to re-read the code to figure it out myself 
- all a ui driver mainly needs to 
do was interface with 
uidrives/_base - and generate evens like uidirver/wx - 
internally we don't give too much a crap how it works :). 
Derek thought that copying the existing wxpython driver 
and starting to change around would 
be a good start. James said that documenting the UI 
driver was on the release plan for 0.6.x, but he would willingly 
bring that forward if it meant someone else could write a new 
UI driver (instead of him).","2002-11-28","58"

,

Jan Ischebeck (siesel) felt that his 
original
e-mail had pretty much done that. Derek did not remember 
seeing this originally - it was a good basis but 
i would like to see more a 
'numbered' list (after dicussion) of goals and importance 
(similar to appserver) - like goal one is a a truly strong 
copyleft licensed integration engine written with copyleft 
tools i.e. this list will be part of the faq so when 
datajunction is available on linux and someone says how come 
you 're invented the wheel' we can point to the list of 
goals and the date and say 'nothing that matched that' 
existed at the time. Jan agreed, 
but I still would like a list of 
'integrator will|could|should do this' and 'integrator won't 
shouldn't do that' list. Derek did not 
we need so much the 'wont' do this 
unless there is something that we REALLY want to make clear 
it wont do - as the 'do this' list should keep people busy 
enough to not do the 'wont do' :) - but if there are some 
'common tempatations' that we dont want to do, we should list 
them as wont do :) He suggested 
take your email you posted - 
refactor based on jcater and my comments - number order in 
sequence you would plan to implement and repost for comment - 
then take comments you get and modify and post a final goals 
list (not final as in never changing but final as in final

'sync' database thing scares me - but i would like integrator 
to do that 'some day' - so as long as its down on the list a 
bit i think its pertinent. The same coudl be said for 'real 
time' integration i.e. i dont think we should focus on either 
one of those early on - but certainly they could be long term 
goals. Jan was not especially attatched to the 
database synchronisation idea, but had put this in 
Integrator rather than add it to Application Server. 
Derek felt that sync is just an 
integration routine ran more than one time - and that we have 
a management tool that you can 'cron' basically the sync or 
such. Jan said that AppServer would need a 'cron' 
tool as well. Derek said there 
should be a gui cron somewhere - hopefully in python - we 
could build on. If not we need to write one :) - as thats 
needed for 'enterprises'.","2002-11-29","58"

"2017","856","1","It was asked how business rules were expressed in GNUe.
Derek Neighbors (derek) explained currently 
in 2 tier mode you define 'triggers' (or rules) and they are written in 
python - you can put them in the form themselves or you can put in 
external 'repositories' which more than one form can call. 
Triggers were implemented by 'events' - 
so you have for example a prefocus in event for an entry widget - 
that gets 'fired' before focus happens on an entry widget. You can 
then call a 'trigger' when this event fires - it can be directly in 
the form or 'imported' from a repository (if you want reuse).
James Thompson (jamest) added that n-tier business rules would be done 
by the Application Server implementing the 
rules on the server side - but it's not ready yet. He agreed 
that having to define triggers on each individual form was not 
ideal - i've had multiple forms in the past 
in Oracle sql*forms that shared logic - it was a major PITA - our 
importable repository (libraries) are a small attempt to address 
this. Derek agreed - from my 
understanding of shared repository with imports, for the most part i 
think it gives most of the functionality of an application server wrt 
central rule base. I think central importable repository speaks a bit 
to that problem and surely appserver will.","2002-12-01","58"
"2018","857","1","Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked how PRE-UPDATE 
trigger work? what is the difference it with PRE-COMMIT? 
James Thompson (jamest) explained pre-update 
only gets called if a record is modified so the save will generate a sql 
update statement - vs  pre-insert which only gets called on new record 
inserts. Jason Cater (jcater) expanded 
pre-commit gets called whether it's an insert, 
update, or a delete, so for any given change to the database, 
one of the Pre-Insert, Pre-Delete or Pre-Update triggers would be called, 
then always the Pre-Committ trigger. (It was obviously up to application 
form authors to decide whether to attatch code to the first trigger, the 
second trigger or both, depending on what they wanted to do.) Dmitry said 
that was what he had expected, but did not get 
it working. James warned how we claim 
it should work does not necessarily mean that is how it is working 
:) Dmitry had also tried ON-SWITCH 
trigger and i hoped it catch an event when 1 entry comes up after 
initialization but it is not. James said

too but haven't looked into why it's what way.","2002-12-02","58"

used to build GNUe Packages with ERP functionality - 
think of GNUe Forms like Oracle 
SQL Forms - gnue-forms helps to rapidly build data-entry forms 
to enterprise db. Andrew said that, to scale up to 
the levels needed for the largest enterprise, GNUe would be 
using an application server between 
the client & the database to handle the logic. 
Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) said that ""enterprise-level"" implied 
usually high scalability and

is that mysql is not popular with the GNUe developers

dbdriver problems seem to be mysql specific. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) preferred SAB-DB - there is a channel on this network #sapdb that regularly has sap
developers in it (europe time). However as
SAPDB was pretty complex, Jason Cater (jcater) expressed his opinion that
PostgreSQL was simplier and it's one of the better
supported databases.","2002-11-04","59"

shall we do about that mysql fix & the runForm issue for the

its a biggie for anyone, I say we do 0.4.3. Andrew said 
probably only for me :) - and i've got 
the fixes in my local copy. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said 
if 0.5.0 will be after jan 1st we need a 
0.4.3 to fix the runform - as i will need it before then. If 0.5.0 will 
be around jan 1st i think i can wait. Andrew said that 
to fix runForm, you just uncomment one 
line. Derek was willing to package 
a 0.4.3 with the two fixes runform and mysql patches - especially if 
they are done and applied in the branch - /me would suspect a release 
wouldnt take long and would be worth it.
Jason said I certainly have no 
problem with doing a 0.4.3 release, but would probably not 
have time to do this himself. ","2002-11-04","59"

the release tarballs, or update to the recent CVS branch? 
Andrew replied we're still discussing whether 
to do 0.4.3 after the uncovering of a couple of bugs :). 
Derek said he could apply the patches to the CVS stable (0.4.x) branch 
if necessary. He asked Jeff how to make 
gnue debs from what you have? so that we can make the debs? and then give 
to you for update. Jeff said that it was just a few commands from 
the command line. Derek said that, even if they were not immediately 
uploaded to sid, the Debian unstable distribution, 
we can get those in our gnuenterprise.org 
site - so i can start alpha testing them :).","2002-11-04","59"
"2025","860","3","Jeff said There are three places you need to 
change for a new release - 1) The tarball.  
2) debian/changelog 3) The hardcoded date in debian/rules - It basically 
needs to know what the tar directory is set to. Also, you might have to 
touch all of the files in debian/patches since dbs updates with -p0 instead 
of -p1 He was looking at changing from dbs 
to cbs to accomidate that better, though. He explained 
'dbs' is ""Doogie's build system"".  'cbs' is 
""Colin's Build system"".  Basically all Debian requires for your packaging 
is that you take a ""ar"" archive of all of the files you want in the final 
distro, and another ""ar"" archive of all of the control files (preinst, 
postinst, etc).   And it doesn't much care how you get them there.
So a series of tools have appeared over the years to make that a little 
easier on the developper. Andrew confirmed

ON-SWITCH trigger was now being called whenever a form was opened,

all at once. However, the wx toolkit is a bit flakey
sometimes so alongside the wx strategy we are currently developing ""native""
UIs. The GTK2 one is there already (but still buggy).
Next on the list is Win32 native API, which should be... interesting.

Get sued by lots of people then. Alternatively, 
if you did a book collection and allowed for 
an interface to the dewey decimal system, you could probably tag it as

of JBoss and Sun about the Open Source J2EE 1.4 spec aap server would have 
any effect in the development of GNUe - because as I understand, one of the 
reasons to chose Python was that Java wasn't open source. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said that open source was not the same as free software, 
and, to be fair, the preference for python over 
java isn't just about freedom - python is 
a better lang for a large, volunteer project like this as it produces fairly 
claen code - and is, if anything, more multi-platform than java. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said java is not scalable for 
client stuff - before I joined GNUe I did a 
complete forms-equiv package in java - we abandoned it because on our 
high-end windows machine it was barely usable - and only a few people had 
high-end machines :) /me considers himself to be a fairly efficient coder 
too - but even then, the free/open source aspect was huge too - but 
regardless we LOVE python, adding you 
couldn't pay me to switch back to java. James Thompson (jamest) 
agreed - dude - don't even get me started on 
java based solutions :) Keith asked Do 
you think GNUe App Serv could be the JBoss of the Python World?

experiences in setting GNUe clients in PDAs? Perry Lorier

another option would be via HTML - or 
WML (the WAP phone equivalent of HTML). Derek Neighbors 
(revDeke) did not know if gnue will ever 
work on a palm pilot - they are severely underpowered for gnue type 
applications. I would expect the gnue core team target for PDAs will be
Sharp Zaurus and iPAQ - not to say someone else couldnt make a palm or 
that palmOS may improve. Matthew Emmett (memmett) suggested 
an ssh client when the curses interface 
matures. Keith said Well it doesnt 
have to be Palms in this case. Derek thought that 
iPAQ and Zaurus show extreme 
promise - i KNOW iPAQ will about 
run gnue as it sits - i hope to be in position to prove it after Xmas 
:) - as virtually anything available in debian is available to iPAQ. 
Zaurus would be a stronger stretch as we would likely need a qtopia 
client for forms. He thought these were 
the only current PDAs worthy of devoting 
time and energy to at this point. Keith said that iPAQs came 
with Windows CE on ROM. Jason said debian runs 
on the newer iPAQs iirc. He offered anyone 
who wants to dropship me an iPAQ - I'll get a GNUe driver working for them

how goes the html
user interface being written for GNUe Forms. 
Jeff replied I wanted to chat 
with you to see how important perfect representation is.
I can't seem to get a perfect grid. I think the problem 
is that all of the functions assume variable width fonts, 
so there's no reasonable way to get the information I 
need to do it, pointing to a sample page. 
James asked right now you're 
doing direct placement right along the lines of 
pseudocode like - print label 1 at  
x*whatTheBrowserThinksIsASingleCharWidth and 
y*yadaYadaCharHeight - is that correct?
so how hard would it to seperate this renderer (i guess 
I'll call it that) from the logic dealing w/ passing data 
back and form state - then the renderer would basically 
build the html and a single call like render.publish() 
would spit out the html - you could then use a different 
html table based renderer in place of this for the time 
being. He was not sure how the existing phpForms 
client did it. Jeff said If I 
understand the current renderers they get a series of 
calls to add widgets and then display their form, usually 
deferring that off to the toolkit, and then just invoke 
the display.  We can just buffer that, assuming that I 
can do some sort of class scope variable, or global 
variable. The thing is, I don't see how you could do it 
with tables either. Also with tables you lose any 
accessibility and PDA rendering you might've had. (You 
might not have it anyway, given that label and form 
widgets aren't really associated) I think if I could see 
a form that's done with tables, I could certainly figure 
it out with CSS> Tables are just going to do it with 
pixels, and I can use those just as easy. The 
problem was getting a monospace 
grid. HTML's not tuned for that, since it's pretty rare 
that someone would want to do position on a monospace 
grid. James did some digging, and discovered that
the code for the simple 
client 
had been in Jan Ischebeck's (siesel) home web directory - 
it didn't get reactivated 
after the crash but he restored it from the 
back-up. Jeff had a look - he felt it produced very ugly 
HTML.","2002-12-13","60"

is the hidden benefit of feature plans to our core developers 
- which I don;t think jcater/jamest anticipated - People look

jan coming along with the jsclient? He would use this 
for screen writes/updates as 
previously discussed in 
.
Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he had not looked at this, but 
I think anything needs to be integrated 
with gnue-forms. Charles said using
jsforms for screen writes eliminates having to redo it in HTML - 
also allows screen updates without reloading. jsForms will then have two
builtin methods for connectivity: appserver via XMLRPC and webserver via 
CGI - or you could make them seperate instead in one client. or one code
base.  Jason Cater (jcater) said I don't 
see the two being compatable in the same client - either you use the 
gnue-forms backend or you don't in a client. Charles said 
your gnue forms backend in this case is the 
CGI. Jason said then you aren't reusing 
the gnue-forms backend. Charles understood, but said that the 
bottom line is, if you don't use javascript
you'll hafta reload the screen for every request.. which is fine, but not
very pleasant. so why not just use javascript for webbrowser layout.
javascript XMLRPC client is also very light.. should require nothing but 
appserver.. I don't see much point in writing an HTML based XMLRPC client 
when it can all be done in javascript.","2002-12-15","60"
"2052","877","2","Jason was not sure of the need for an XMLRPC
client in js. Charles said then why 
even bother with an appserver? we should just expect users to connect to 
our database across the internet? Jason said 
it's not n-tier vs 2-tier AT ALL - it's about 
diversion of code bases - you in effect are ditching gnue-forms 
for an appserver + javascript half-ass solution. Charles said 
that javascript was the only way for an HTML client
to eliminate reloading of 
screens/pages - eliminating screen
reloads makes a webclient FEEL like a real client. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said if your
requirement for a 'web' application is that it 'feel like a real 
application' - why not just use a real application - for example forms is
fully 'internet' aware. Charles said 
thin clients was the issue. 
Derek said last i looked gnue-forms was 
smaller than about any webbrowser out there - for those with a 
preoccupatino for putting the kitchen sink in a webbroswer so they can 
say 'zero administration' i will gladly make a mozilla plugin of 
gnue-forms that doesn nothing but install forms - and call it via plugin 
architecture - just like flash and java do.","2002-12-15","60"
"2053","877","3","Jeff suggested 
there should be a single integrated forms back 
end - With a javascript, don't you have 
to provide all the forms functionality rewritten in javascript? 
The HTML User Interface he was working on would just use the normal 
GNUe Forms code, with a seperate HTML UI wrapper, accessed via CGI. 
Derek clarified btw: im not against having 
javascript of sorts in an html client - i am against rewriting forms 
client in javascript Even though not all broswers supported it, 
he personally felt that supporting only 
'modern' browsers woudl be acceptable.","2002-12-15","60"
"2054","877","4","Charles felt that his approach was not that different - 
all you are doing is eliminating your HTML 
screens with javascript screens.. the javascript code would then 
communicate with the CGI/gnueforms to update the forms, etc, etc. - 
look at javascript as a blank canvas that allows you to communicate with 
the server in the background. and how is that not the same with 
HTML? Jason and Derek still felt this involved re-implementing a
lot of existing GNUe Forms code from python to javascript. Derek said 
look at the UI driver - and UI driver 
system. Charles said I'm saying that
instead of writing a bunch of HTML output routines and creating a normal
clunky web client, just add some javascript to enable background 
communicate and eliminate screen writes.. no big deal.. doesn't require
rewriting forms client.. just involves using javascript instead of HTML 
output. Jason said that any HTML client should work in the same 
way as the other UI drivers, with the UI driver sitting on top of the 
core Forms code and producing HTML - what Charles was describing was more 
like re-writing both the UI driver and some of the core Forms code in 
Javascript.","2002-12-15","60"
"2055","877","5","Charles said CGI (gnueforms) outputs 
SOMETHING... right now you are wanting to output straight HTML...
why not integrate javascript to build forms from the CGI instead of 
HTML? either way you have to do one or the other.. Jason said 
because that ties you to javascript. 
No-one else seemed to see this as an issue. Jeff said the important 
issue was that there must be no business 
logic in the jsForms package. appserver needs to hand out ""display, 
to the best of your ability, the following widgets"" If it can provide 
hints on top of that, like ""numeric only field"" that jsForms can benefit 
from, great. But that business logic to sort all of that out can't be in 
the cilent. That's important for a few reasons: 1) We should minimize 
the amount of trust we have of remote clients. 2) We cannot chain 
ourselves down with implementing business logic in many places. My 
opinion is that eventually there's a place for jsForms - in that 
gnue-forms *also* shouldn't be trusted. I would love to see a version 
of gnue-forms-server that communicated to all of its clients through 
appservers. Because right now it's still possible to hack gnue-forms.
We're still trusting code running on an untrusted machine.
He thought potentially the HTML client should 
use Javascript as an add-on. Note that it can't be required if you want 
to do much with PDAs and cell phones. (I think they are the most 
interesting market for the HTML client long term).

seen a cell phone running an SSH client last week.","2002-12-15","60"

common, doesn't it? or at least significance. James said he 
was i'm using common outside of gnue a
lot now - any python program I 
do is based upon common. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said 
I don't really know what common offers 
aside from database abstrction. Derek said it was much 
more than that - in the sense it 
handles master detail and such. It was similar to 
proprietary tools like BDE (Borland Database Engine) and VCL 
(Visual Component Library). James said just about the only bit of 
Common he did not use was the database abstraction, as 
it does'nt work w/o major effort outside 
GNUe. However, basing my apps on 
GClientApp gives me a logging system GDebug that features output 
redirection to a file - good for non interactive apps - a command 
line parsing system that is rather feature complete and easy to use - 
built in profiling engine - a configuration system, it's a trival 
matter to add .ini config suport to a GClientApp - and that allows 
automatically a ""pine"" style config with system settings, user 
overrides, and system fixed (non overridable) settings - this is 
stuff almost all my apps use. Jason also mentioned the 
man page generation and the command-line 
debugger.","2002-12-19","61"
"2060","880","3","Jason also noted common has a strong 
DOM-style XML parser library - that I use in some of my stuff - as 
well as db abstraction - and the start of client-server abstraction
i.e., base your code on GServerApp.py and you get cross-platform daemon 
initing plus rpc abstraction - /me hasn't used the daemon-mode stuff 
outside of gnue yet. Also we have a 
wicked curses library - called cursing - that is really shaping 
up. Jeff asked how the DOM library worked. Jason explained 
it's a DOM-like model - not a DOM 
implementation - it's more an 
XML-To-Object and Object-To-XML library. James added 
and when using it you also gain  a trigger 
system - so that it was fairly simple to add triggers defined in xml 
to your objects. The forms, reports triggers are based upon this code.
It exports named objects into the trigger namespace 
automatically. Jason said what is 
really cool is that it's an Object marshalling system that currently 
has an XML mode - there's nothing stopping someone from writing an 
Object-to-SQL and SQL-to-Object layer - to store objects (forms, 
reports, etc) in a database - that has been discussed before.

rocks my socks.","2002-12-19","61"
"2061","881","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel), having read 
, asked 
about error handling of non existant object 
identifiers in appserver. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said it 
had been agreed that if in ""store"" multiple 
objects are stored with a single call - then a failed validation of a 
single object causes that none of the objects are stored, but an 
exception to be raised The issue now was 
if we call ""remove"" - and one of the 
objectid's to delete doesn't exist - will the rest of the objects be 
deleted, or will there be an exception an no deleting be done at 
all? Jan thought store and delete 
should use the same mechanism. i.e. full """"rollback"""" of action in case 
of error. Reinhard agreed - calls 
to the ""raw"" interface should be atomic - that is all is done or nothing 
is done.","2002-12-19","61"
"2062","881","2","Jan asked how should the 
exeption be defined? It should return the OID of the invalid object.
And what about multiple invalid objects in a store operation. Should only 
the first one be returned, or should all be returned? Reinhard 
thought invalid objectid's probably indicate 
an error in the calling code don't they? Jan agredd, but said that 
object calls could be invalid for reasons other than an invalid Object 
ID - It could possibly be an object with an 
valid oid, but which don't fit some constraints. Reinhard 
agreed, giving the classic example of trying to delete a customer 
that still has open orders. 
He could imagine some system like 
""get_last_error"" which returns a text like ""Can't remove customer, 
because it still has open orders"" Jan suggested adding a 
system table: session_errors - then you can 
get one error or many errors at one time, and you don't have to define new commands. Each error would need 
the following informations defined: 1. the error text (like can't remove 
customer... 2. the involved object (stored as oid) - probably 3. a system 
interpretable status flag - probably 4. the involved table.","2002-12-19","61"

implemented? Jan said they are partly 
implemented. geasSessionManager functions calling the appropriate session 
functions - geasSession functions calling the appropriate class 
functions - at the moment geasSession is finished and I'm just working at 
geasBClass.py. He had not commited 
geasBClass.py yet, because there's still to much subject to heavy changes 
in it. Reinhard took the hint, and said 
I'll keep my fingers out of new API

at the ""python object faker"" - officially known as the ""language

check gnue.conf/formFontEncoding in the beginning of GBaseApp.py, how 
to do that properly? Jason Cater (jcater)
said if it's something that will be accessed 
in GBaseApp, we have to rename it to something besides 
formFontEncoding, as this implied it was specific to Forms. 
Dmitry realised that the code was written the way it was because 
gettext translation is initialized in the 
beginning of GBaseApp - before any other subsystems are 
initialized. Jason said that, regardless of the renaming issue, 
there was a bigger issue, in that the code logically therefore needed 
to know which encoding had been specified in the gnue.conf configuration 
file before it had had a chance to load it! Dmitry wondered 
may we initialize gettext later but before 
we output any messages ? James Thompson (jamest) wondered 
why is this happening before the config 
system is init'd? - it looks like 
it's only adding _ to the namespace of the app. He then realised 
in files like GFClient _ is used prior to 
it's _init_ even being called. He suggested a possible 
workaround and noted i was going to store 
string references to be process later - but that doesn't help the 
assignment of them.","2002-12-21","61"
"2065","883","1","James Thompson (jamest) was still working on 
merging in some of the code from Marcos Dione's (StyXman) patch. 
This patch aimed to re-merge the changes made by Project Papo for their version 
of GNUe into the main code base, as previously discussed in 
.
He explained instead of the generic message box 
thing you created I'm implementing <dialog> instead. Marcos said 
they had used the message box mostly for showing 
things from triggers. He asked now that forms 
can call forms from triggers - is there any way to return things? 
James said probably via it parameters 
support - plus <dialog> will offer 
this - <dialog> is really just an alias for 
<form style=""dialog"">. So whatever 
parameters passed to a form are passed back at close IIRC - so if you mod them 
you'll see the changes. Marcos noted that runform was not in 0.4.1.
Derek Neighbors (derek) confirmed this is fixed 
in 0.4.3. As of time of writing, there were no Debian packages for
the 0.4.3 release - worse case you can get the 
0.4.3 release or the 0.5.0 pre-release as tarballs. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) said I haven't done new uploads because I 
haven't had time to think about the bugs you posted, and because the 0.4.3 
packages don't contain the man pages.","2002-12-22","61"
"2066","883","2","Later, James confirmed that <dialog> will 
allow you to use any gnue form definition as a popup from another form, 
returning values. Once I'm done implementing 
some of forms current popups will be replaced with build in <dialogs> - 
like the jump to record dialog and lookup dialogs. This would be included in the 0.5.x series of releases, but 
probably not 0.5.0 - although i'm almost done with 
it - i plan to finish this week, the holidays willing.","2002-12-22","61"

How feature complete is 0.1.0? Is it 50% of needed 
features already implemented? Or 20%? Marcos said this 
depends. if by 'of needed' mean all that was planned 
for december, it's 90% I guess. if you mean the whole system, I would say like 
25/30% - but I can't guaranty that.","2002-12-22","61"
"2069","885","1","Further to 
, 
Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he had intended to work some more on the 
HTML interface all of this week.  I had 
forgotten about Christmas. It should be in CVS 
Mid next week, probably,.
The initial checkin will probably be stubs, 
and then I'll implement all of the widgets.  It should be really 
quick to do. The hard part will be the session handling and getting 
""gnue-forms"" to act like a proper cgi-bin. Even session handling won't 
be too bad, though.  Probably just use the databsae login name and 
password and rely on the web server to SSL everything and all 
that. By ""proper cgi-bin,"" he meant It 
would need to handle all of the environment variables and everything 
to pull inthe information. Right now none of that machinery 
exists. Charles Rouzer (Mr_You) asked 
isn't there a CGI library builtin to the 
core python distro? Jeff thought Probably.
But how to best plug in into forms? It would be best to use a helper 
library. Charles suggested generally 
all you need to do is make sure every output screen has: 
""Content: text/html\n\n"" as the first line. Jeff accepted 
Oh - for output sure. But the input processing 
needs to be done - Form variables and all that are annoying to 
parse. Charles agreed - thats the 
biggest job of the CGI library. usually thats all I use the CGI libraries 
for is variables and one function to print content header.
some have included extra functionality like tables, etc.","2002-12-23","61"
"2070","885","2","Charles asked have you thought about layout?
ie. x,y cordinates. Jeff said Yup - Layout 
will be all CSS - So we'll use x,y from that.  It won't be perfect, but thats 
fine. Charles said I guess the #em stuff 
is ""x,y"" like. Jeff said It's really not 
ideal, but it's the correct layout solution for the medium. The 
alternative solution - tables (as used in the phpForms client that was no 
longer under active development) gives an accurate 
layout but is fugly. If we add some way of 
associating a label with its input widget, then we can easily use the 
non-table layout for accessibility needs, as well as PDA/Cellphone 
input. - this would need another
field in the GNUe Forms Definition (.gfd). As most PDA/Cellphone web 
browsers could not render either graphics or tables, this was needed to 
make sure that the label ended up somewhere near the input field.","2002-12-23","61"

integrate it with webmin.. I'm not sure if it will strip header text...

that papo were still using their own CVS as I'm still

said that was my point - it takes time away from 
adding new features to try to sync with them - and then they out of sync 
again. He isnt overly 
concerned from a gnue standpoint, just would like to help papo out by giving a 
consistent tree -  but the gnue team cant 
constantly spend time trying to resync. Marcos said that, for some time, 
we (almost) stopped to add features to our cvs ('cept for 
bug fixes).","2003-01-01","63"
"2081","891","4","Marcos added I guess we'll have our cvs anyways, as we 
have functionality that will never get into gnue. unless there were other ways to 
introduce them, like delegation in the db arch, as discussed in

Derek said so what you are saying is you want a 
fork. Marcos disagreed - it's the last thing we 
want. Derek said well if you have your own cvs 
you have a fork - it might be a minor fork but 
a fork none the less. He felt that GNUe had bent 
over backwards to apply patches that you would stop using your own cvs so we wouldnt 
have such headaches. James said we're not fast 
enough for their business needs - that's all - i mean it's been weeks/months(?) 
Derek said well its a two edge sword - you have dialogs 
almost done and styxman will spend two weeks implementing or back port - so whom is 
slowing whom down? Applying patches generated from papo's CVS back into the 
main GNUe CVS was time-consuming, and was only really worth it if papo were intending 
to use GNUe's CVS in the future.","2003-01-01","63"

*don't* want to fork. We're doing our best to work with what we currently

there are two types of forks - a pure fork... we make 
foo, you want to go right i want to go left and we fork - and - a mild fork, we 
make foo, you want to go right, we want to go right, you want to dress in red, we 
want to dress in blue - in a mild fork it makes sense to 'share' as much as 
possible - as things are going same direction. He 
would rather see papo just use gnue and drop own 
cvs but understands business requirements and 
timelines. However, just like in a data 
conversion if you continue entering data in old system you will never cut over to 
the new one.","2003-01-01","63"
"2083","891","6","He felt that this dialog sample proves as well - 
there is functionality that might come into our cvs you want - and its murder for 
you to back port it. However, if dialogs 
will take you 2 weeks to do - and its in our system - and if it takes two weeks 
to get cvs head to give you proper functionality, then there was no issue 
as the work could be done in GNUe's CVS directly and 
you are in sync - /me isnt saying thats the case - but you have to look at such trade 
offs. Federico said that getting the papo CVS in sync with GNUe's would 
take much longer than two weeks - Marcos had played 
catch up for quite a while in nov/dec, and he never got anywhere near the head 
branch. Derek felt that the only way to re-sync was 
to check out our cvs - then add the functionality to 
it thats missing and submit as patches - one patch per functionality - not a giant 
patch - a. that will minimize amount of wait time you would incur from us - b. that 
ensures our cvs does what you need - in the mean time stop adding stuff to your 
cvs. Federico said that the Problem is, as I 
understand it, that if we do that, our stuff STOPS WORKING. And we must have a 
widely deployable version in two months. Debugged and tested. Derek 
said well then i would say it behooves you to do 
ASAP - unless you forever want a fork - as if you deploy you will NEVER get back 
to our cvs - as you will never be able to 'stop' adding features to sync up. 
Again im not saying you must do this, or even necessarily that you should do 
this - that is up to you - just be forewarned we wont take patches created from a 
cvs other than our own. Marcos did not think there was actually much 
difference in functionality. Federico agreed - there's 
not actually that much more that we need... just now, a few UI things, and 
then we can rest. Derek warned that the forthcoming changes to the GNUe 
Forms Definition format (.gfd) in version 0.5.0 would make papo's CVS 
incompatiable going forward without MAJOR work on 
your tree.","2003-01-01","63"
"2084","891","7","Marcos noted that there were some changes in papo's CVS that 
won't get into gnue ever. and we know that. 
Derek said for somethings like that if one off deals 
you could treat like patches to the Linux kernel, 
where its a 'mini fork' for specific 
functionality. Federico agreed, but said that the bigger issue was 
We have stuff we need, and that GNUe wants but 
does not yet have in HEAD. Marcos said that, as papo had several 
devlopers, they would still want to have a CVS even if just for version 
control on their own patches.","2003-01-01","63"
"2085","891","8","Federico fully appreciated Derek's point about ideally merging CVS before 
papo did a wider release, but it's a financing 
thing - if we get a solution that *works* 
by march, we get the funding we need to continue work, and that work goes 
according to *our* schedule. Derek could relate to that, but warned 
if you dont make papo tree like 0.5.0 it will be 
an utter bitch for you to back port any new functionality we put in. 
He appreciated that papo have always been more 
than eager to share their improvements, i want to make it abundantly clear 
the gripe is not that they want to fork gnue and not give back - its more 
that applying patches is utter hell, because they are created off a cvs tree 
other than our own and in masse. Federico said that the funding 
situation means that we *will* do some shit 
twice, which we could have gotten right the first time. But if doing so will 
cost us our release date, we won't even get to the point where we can get it 
right once. Derek agreed - the question 
is does it outweigh what it will cost you to merge the other stuff over 
later? Once all of the papo patches from November had been applied, 
our cvs head after those patches might not be all 
that radiacally different feature wise - anywho its up to you guys to decide 
whats best for you. Federico said that papo's clients were not that 
used to software development cycles - they were 
Sustainable development organizations, 
mostly. - They have great trust in us, 
and we do all in our power to keep that trust.","2003-01-01","63"

, 
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) said he had been 
thinking about the SKU thing.. I can imagine 3 ways to organize a
Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) - 1) 
Simple serialized number which is N digits long. 2) A number with N 
segments one or more of which are a serialized number and one or more are 
derived from predefined lookup tables and 3) a segmented number completely 
derived from lookup tables. Segments could either have 
a predefined padded length or be 
delimited with or without a contraint on 
their length/scope. If there 
was a way to configure how a SKU were established, then you could use that 
information to create your forms to manipulate them based on that 
configuration. This meta-data could be queried to build the 
form according to the data extrapolated. 
Descriptions would be labels, if the segment was a lookup a dropdown could 
be created, etc..","2003-01-03","63"
"2087","892","2","Derek Neighbors (derek) said the way i planned 
on doing it was drop downs and triggers - you selected the 'categories' or 
such that generate the numbers. He added i 
really think making a dynamic form is a bad solution - at least in the gnue 
world. Maybe for gnue proper - but getting sku numbers that complex in gnue-sb 
i think is over kill. The main requirement for his clients was to be 
able to generate new SKU for new items using pre-existing categories from 
drop-down lists, but also use SKUs that did not fit the standard pattern - 
i.e. the sku# is a free form field - but you can 
use the categories to generate a number. His users would typically have 
three levels of category. Mike said that, with too many segments, this 
could would create very large numbers and very 
large numbers are hard to manage outside of the computer. 
However, as if I were a consultant this could be a 
bonus to be able to adapt to a running system rather than expect a migration if

"2088","893","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked how should 
I use the .04to0.5 conversor? Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said 
run it with your form as param - old form 
will be saved with <name>-PRE050 name. The conversion
routine, which was designed to convert GNUe Form Definitions (.gfd) 
from the format used in version 0.4.x and earlier to the new format 
that split the logic and the display, was not completely automatic, 
but in most cases mine worked. 
Marcos said ok, I'll finish the file by 
hand. Later, Jason Cater explained that the syntax for the 
conversion script was gfd04to05.py 
<source.gfd> [<destination.gfd>] - if you specify 
two names on the command line, then the second one is the output name 
and the first one is left unchanged - if you only specify one form, 
then the original is renamed and the new one is created in its 
place.","2003-01-03","63"
"2089","893","2","Earlier, Marcos reported various errors trying to run a converted 
form, most of which seemed to be caused by the convertor putting 
all my buttons in the logic part. 
This was a very simple form, just with a few buttons. He 
wondered if this was the problem - can a 
form have no logic? Jason asked 
do you have a <button> as a child of 
a <block> ??. Marcos said this was true of 
all the buttons. Jason said that 
the conversion script was not accounting for 
buttons in blocks. Marcos confessed we 
have more complicated things like that. boxes inside boxes inside blocks 
and so on. would that be 'wrong'? Jason said 
well, the converter won't support it - nor 
will the CVS head version of GNUe Forms - 
I'm not sure what it will do.","2003-01-03","63"
"2090","893","3","Dmitry and Marcos concluded that the new format .gfds always had to 
have a <logic> section - at a minimum, this had to contain a 
<block> tag to specify which datasource to use. The conversion 
script would fail with very simple forms that had no datasource, but 
converted forms could then be made to work by manually adding a dummy 
datasource - Marcos noted that tmpDataSource 
is valid.","2003-01-03","63"
"2091","893","4","Marcos asked about containers for widgets. Jason said 
we haven't implemented containers yet - in 
the old version or the new - with the exception of a 
<page>. Marcos said I sent a 
patch for that one a looong time ago and it almos got in, but it was 
disabled for 0.4.0 release, AFAIK. Jason explained 
it broke a lot of existing forms - when 
applying I thought it was backward compatable - but I haven't had time 
to correct it. He thought we are 
leaning to not having a dual function <box> tag, but an actual 
container tag of sorts - but I'm not 100% sure what we want to do there 
yet.","2003-01-03","63"
"2092","893","5","Dmitry asked where should trigger be tied 
to field tag in logic or entry tag in layout? what's the difference if 
both ways are possible? Jason said there's 
not a 1:1 relationship between a field (logic) and an entry (layout)... 
there's a 1:many. most of the time you'd probably want to do a <field> 
trigger. He confirmed that on-change triggers should exist for 
field tags, as for entry tags.","2003-01-03","63"
"2093","894","1","Marcos Dione (StyXman) asked Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) whether he knew what 
was the supposed semantics for the different masks (display, input, format). 
Marcos needed them to show just a few decimal but 
keeping all the decimals internally. James Thompson (jamest) was 
afraid that's up in the air right now IIRC. 
Marcos said he just want to know if I should 
implement displaymask or format mask. and what will be the use in thew 
future. James thought there is
already work done on format masks, it's already in the code base but not 
in use IIRC. Marcos raised another question: 
ok, let's do the question in a better way (I 
hope): what are display, input and format mask for? Especially, the
difference between display and format? Input seems rather clear. 
James noted that his answer came only from memory: 
fields can display differently when you edit 
them vs when you're not in them. The best place to see this is in a date 
field, as IIRC it's the furthest along. When you enter the field, 
2003/01/06 may be displayed for editing. When you exit it may flip to 
read ""Monday, Jan. 6th 2003"". I _think_ display is non editing and format 
is editing, but again, I'm not sure. Marcos replied - 
it sounds to me, but I may be wrong, that display 
is for showing (Mon, Jan 6th 2003), input for input (2003/01/06), and format 
for internal representation (20030106) and James, on the whole, agreed: 
that could very well be. I think that 2 of the 3 
are in use and the 3rd one is pending proper setup of the format definition. 
The best source of info on this would be jason. Mike Vincent 
(Vee2d2) noted that there's a bit of information 
in the forms dev guide (.5) pg 24.. but the only thing documented is 
datetime.","2003-01-05","63"
"2094","894","2","Later, Marcos caught Jason Cater (jcater) and he answered immediately: 
masks don't work. That's part of
0.5. However, Marcos was also interested what 
are they exactly for. I mean, de dev-guide talks about display and input masks, 
what is format for? Jason was still wondering if GNUe needed the 
""format"" mask. Input mask --> when field is in input 
mode, the mask used to validated/let the user enter the value, display mask 
--> how the field is displayed when user is not editing it, format mask 
--> (if there's a need) how the field is actually stored in the 
database.","2003-01-05","63"

to do something like colspan in reports? (in general, in native xml 
report format). James Thompson (jamest) offered using 
simple tabulation, just put in empty column defs
<out:col/>. Dmitry was trying to do 
simple text output that fit with 80 chars screen to be send by
email. It'd be great to split one output db row on two rows in report ans span 
wide cells if needed. James thought that 
with a little effort you might be able to get a trigger to 
do it, but the trigger support in reports is functional bu not complete. I would 
think some type of post-change trigger on a field that split the data and stored 
in 2 non-bound fields would do it. Dmitry asked 
how to reach different report objects from report 
trigger? James said that they should be able 
to be referenced by name report.fieldName. There were no examples 
on this as of time of writing, because it seems that no one had used triggers in 
reports. James expected to write an example sometime later the same week.","2003-01-05","63"

to move to Bayonne on a totally shoestring budget.  
probably can't even afford new hardware, still using ISA phone cards 
;). Bayonne now had a demo mode that could run on an ordinary 
sound card so you can test your bayonne 
apps. Daniel Baumann (chillywilly) suggested 
do you call up custumers and yell, 
""show me the money!!!"" - cause that would be the cool way to collect 
on accounts payable ;). Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) asked 
what will be lost in that ""testing"" mode - 
/me owns a coulpe of sound cards and a heap of old soldering parts 
too. Dan said it can't make 
phone calls obviously - you can just listen, and the software will 
function. as it can be very expensive or difficult to test on live 
equipment like a T1. Dmitry felt that might not necessarily 
be the case - we have to find one 2400 
modem to make a phone call. Dan confirmed that, for a basic 
but useful Bayonne installation, your 2400 bps 
modem can be your call center - as long as it could 
do voice ;). John Lenton (Chipaca) 
asked what exactly can bayonne do? is it 
just a call center thing? or is it anything else? Dan 
pointed to the 
website, suggesting go ahead and take a 
look - it's the best IVR on the planet! Think of it as the apache of 
telephony - takes virtually any type of telephony device and turns it 
into a call center, an IVR, voicemail server, etc. John asked 
whether IVR is an interactive voice 
racoon? After a series of various racoon jokes, Dan explained 
IVR == interactive voice response - i.e. a menu 
with prompts and often voicemail - ""thank you for calling XXX.  press 
1 for sales, 2 for collections, and 3 to troutslap chilly"".

explained we have moved the layout management to use a 
separate namespace - this is so we can migrate to supporting multiple layout 
mechanisms w/in the same form i.e., absolute positioning, grid layout, gridbag,

PyQT provides everything we need - we've looked into

things - as it is usable under KDE. You just have to run it w/the GTK driver - 
not ideal, definitely - but not a showstopper either - 
a native curses client was more pressing for us.
aife asked about corba. Jason explained that Forms did not care 
whether talking directly to a database, or using an 
XMLRPC or CORBA-based middleware - forms is independent from the app server - 
all of our tools work independently. There were packages for GNUe in 
the Debian unstable distribution, but I would just

there is 
mdbtools project - 
not sure it is what you need. 
Jason Cater (jcater) felt that /dev/null would be 
the best place for that mdb. Derek explained 
i would like an access driver (even if windows 
only) so that one could point gsd tool to it and have a
GNUe Schema Definition (.gsd) file created which 
they can create a postgres table from.
He realised i can do this today (and move 
data) with pgadmin II - but i would rather have a GNUe way to do this - 
as there are lots of things i dont like about pgadmin II. Jason 
noted that mdbtools looked promising - if it 
includes a library (and not just a stand-alone program) - we can probably 
swig it.","2003-01-20","65"

the reason i'm asking is that 
I came across a project called OSSuite

some back-end code too.  anyhow, the project seems to have some parallels to 
gnue. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) noted i 
haven't heard much of nola/acclite/gnue-sb's status lately, you'll need to 
wait for derek or jcater to be up & about. Ryan said that 
OSSuite had ended up running a cvs for their 
changes to nola as well.  I mentioned gnue and it's evaluation of nola with 
a project guy with ossuite, and got him interested in talking to gnue about 
collaborating on all those changes.","2003-01-21","65"

repository & have seperate projects for forms, reports, appserver etc. 
Daniel agreed - and then a gnue-all or gnue module 
that combine them all. Peter saud this would make 
who-does-what & security easier - but at 
possible cost of loss of co-ordination. Daniel did not think so, as

Forms, to use international character sets. Arturas Kriukovas

Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) said encoding in .po 
is separate thing - my changes was done for that - to have one .po file to

It was standalone - it could either run as a seperate process or (more 
normally) as a library. He can't recall 
what state the GNUe driver is in, if you're wanting to use that. 
Perry Lorier (Isomer) said he was trying to find a very simple database

only happen if string wasn't imported Dave said he was using

the first non-commented line, can you add  string to the list of

replicate the error with a set-up of his own that had previously worked

Bajusz Tamás (btami) confirmed that, previously, wxPython had done 
an import for python's 'string' module, so the GNUe code had not 
needed to - but in wxPython 2.4 it was 
removed. He had fixed the CVS version of GNUe to now ""import

the issues with the win32 interface? Jason Cater (jcater) 
suggested well, the underlying OS would suck - 
that would be issue #1. More specifically, 
wx on Microsoft Windows 
isn't letting us intercept all 
the events that wx under gtk does - so the interaction with the form 
ends up being inconsistent between the two interfaces. He was not 
sure why, but as a result of this a native Win32 
interface is HIGH on our list for forms. Daniel asked 
are there python bindings to the win32

Peter Sullivan (psu) agreed - I would 
guess that people aren;t beating down the door for 0.5.0 as the main

"2134","924","1","It was asked if GNUe was usable for accounting yet. Jason Cater 
(jcater) explained if you are looking for an 
out of the box solution today, then GNUe is not ready for what you 
need - to date, we have been focusing on the underlying tools - 
so the actual accounting packages are still very early - most still 
in planning stages. It was noted that 
Compiere 
(as previously discussed in 
 
and other threads) was open source, but required proprietary Oracle 
database software and a reasonable sized server. Jason Cater (jcater) 
noted I tried compiere at one point - and I 
have oracle installed - I never did get it working :-/ though it 
appears to be a pretty complete accounting solution. 
Peter Sullivan (psu) said that the problem 
is that by the time you;ve installed oracle & java, you 
wonder whether this really counts as ""free"" (in both liberty & 
cash senses). Jason said unfortunately 
there are no good free solutions :( - there are several available that, 
if you cross your fingers, they may handle your specific case. 
Peter speculated maybe some day SAP will 
decide to put R/3 under a free license, same as SAP-DB, but he 
thought this was unlikely.

that had ERP-style functionality - I am evaluating 
Twisted, Webware and GNUe. He was inclined 
to use web interface - but it could be other  GUI , if it's easier. 
He needed to develop modules on inventory, crm, 
production and management - and also interacts with an existing accounting 
package. Jason Cater (jcater) said the 
other two tools you mentioned are designed to help simplify the creation 
of web-based applications - gnue is designed to simplify the creation of 
database-based applications. If you go with the former then you will be 
stuck with a web app (which if that's what you want, then that's not a big 
deal) but you will have to hand-code a lot of the database routines. Gnue 
does not have a strong web-based mentality - so you won't get that aspect 
that you are looking for. Keith said his coworkers 
want to develop in delphi. Jason had not 
realised that delphi does web-based but 
said there's a lot of similarities between delphi 
and gnue, or so I've been told - /me has never used it - derek was a big 
delphi fan. Derek Neighbors (derek) said 
delphi does web - BUT its FUGLY web. Basically 
it makes a .dll (or cgi) - and just passes crap through. Its really rather 
horrid - but if you believe in being a one tool guy - then if your hammer

GNUe Reports is better than

- reportlab is a PDF library mostly, not real

reporting tool. GNUe reports at least initially would use that 
pdf library. He said that the reportlab pdf 
toolkit is free, the reportlab reporting tool is not, but the pdf

operate on the data. The combination of those 3 was

some work - it's not enabled in the debian packages. It was noted 
that copy/paste (select & middle click) did not work - trying to paste text 
from another row seemed to work initially, but it then disappeared when moving 
off (whether by clicking or using the tab key). Andrew couldn't recall whether

"2141","929","1","Keith (kac) asked where he could find any user docs and Mike 
Vincent (Vee2d2) suggested asking questions directly, because 
there's almost always at least someone 
lurking so it's usually best to just state your questions or 
comments.. if not some people read the logs and may answer later 
on. Keith said he would have liked to try GNUe on RedHat, 
so Mike answered - if you were to grab 
the tarballs there should be sample directories contained within 
with some example forms and such to play with.. I would imagine 
they would be installed somewhere by the RPM, in debian they'd 
probably end up somewhere in /usr/share/doc/gnue*/examples. The 
forms will have extension of .gfd and you can run them with the 
forms client, gnue-forms.. some of the examples may require a db, 
though I'm not completely sure of that. After some small 
problems (like installing mxDateTime), Keith 
tried the helloworld sample ""gnue-forms 
helloworld2.gfd"" and i got a screen asking for name & 
address. Keith did not find any GUI stuff and Mike 
listed all available GUIs: right now, 
I think there's a text client, and gui client done with wxpython, 
a gtk2 client is in the works but I havent seen it, and I think a 
native windows client is also in the works but I maybe 
mistaken..","2003-02-09","68"
"2142","929","2","Mike admitted he himself was not too long with GNUe - 
I first bumped into the project a year 
or two ago.. but was too tied up with other things to really spend 
much time, and it really looked like things were still much in 
the planning stages anyway. Recently I checked it out again and 
found they had these neat tools to play with and so I spent a 
couple days reading as much as I could (the web docs, kernel 
cousins (<-real good reads), etc..) then played with the 
samples and stuf. I have a small embroidery business and have made 
a couple attempts to make systems using php, but they've ended up 
being 'clunky' and hard to maintain.. I was about half way 
through my latest attempt when I decided to redo it, in a more 
gnue friendly manner.. So before my drive crashed, I was working 
on an inventory management system.. luckily I think I was able to 
recover that work from the dead drive. This followed Keith's 
history - I'm involved with a small but growing 
company that needs some integrated software to handle its affairs... 
and commercial apps either do too little or too much or at too much 
cost or without giving you escape routes... so I started looking 
at linux as a desktop replacement (RedHat specifically). 
Desktop-wise it's all ok ... e-mail client, which we are 
mega-dependent on is FINE with evolution ... now we lack an 
accounting package and a repair-job-logging system - and they 
need to be integrated ... and if a local coding enterprise is 
going to take forever to do it & keep it for himself, it's more 
sensible to look around and use what's publically avaliable... 
or assist in changing some of that and allowing others to use 
/ reuse / contribute... The only coding environment I can seem 
to get to grips with is the Anjuta/Glade combination, but i'm 
willing to try my hand at anything if it will help... It 
was asked whether ""repair job logging"" system meant ticketing and 
help desk type stuff - if so, Keith should look at 
http://dcl.sf.net. Keith explained 
in more details - we repair photopiers... so I 
need to log jobs, send out guys to fix, and bill clients based on 
time and parts consumed....","2003-02-09","68"

The general consensus was for postgresql - Dan Bethe (ddttmm)
said the main GNUe prefer it and hence 
it has less potential issues, and because mysql is known for data 
corruption under high volume concurrent writes - either mysql 
itself, or the way people tend to use it. 
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) felt that mysql 
is essentially a glorified SQL wrapper around a filesystem.","2003-02-09","68"

Jason Cater (jcater) offered a really short description - 
I can do it in 3 words: ""Hasn't happened 
yet"". Next level up in briefness: ""... but the details are being 
worked out"". Keith explained he needed dcl (in an ideal world) 
to dump billing records into an accounting system. Jason explained 
that dcl's database schema is fairly 
straight forward. I don't even think it'd be hard to get dcl to 
dump that data as a CSV file (if that was an option with your 
accounting package). But sadly, 
gnue's accounting stuff is in the 
works... it woulnd't be usable for anyone looking for an accounting

see stuff really takeoff with actual modules soon.","2003-02-09","68"

well, honestly stability wize we're

old forms but has radikool new UI drivers"". Andrew 
said this depends if someone is

(at least based on 0.4.0 experience). Peter said 
to me, 0.4 remains stable unless & 
until the GNUe core developers say 
otherwise. Jason said I think we've

are things going with the Windows 32 native user interface

according to cvsweb a new ui driver model was commited 8 minutes ago - 
this does not have a win32 module yet but it will hopefully be a step 
in making one easier to create. The intention was not to 
discard the wxPython user interface toolkit - 
it's still the first implementation in the 
new setup. Jason explained we'll just 
offer additional native models. Keith asked 
what is the porpuse of using 3 GUI builders 
at a time? James said i'm doing it 
becase it will help keep the driver system more ui independent 
for Forms, although designer will remain wx 
based only. He hoped to have new drivers done within the next week

radically different in design I would hope it wouldn't take long at 
all.","2003-02-10","68"
"2152","931","1","Tor-Einar Skog (treinar) was interested in the status of HTML/Java 
interfaces. James Thompson (jamest) explained that Jeff Bailey (jbailey)
was, at one time, working on an html based 
forms interface. I haven't heard anything about it lately and I think 
he was going to work on the gtk2 dirvers this week so the html one may 
be backburnerd. Also, Jan Ischebeck (sisel) 
IIRC correctly had the start of a system 
using html/php then started messing with javascript/html driver again, 
i think it's on hold, so I think there are several non-complete drivers 
created already. It would be nice to have a completed one :). 
Tor-Einar said he would attempt to do the HTML 
Interface in Python, outputting HTML/JavaScript. James offered a 
short introduction on forms (the display engine) UI system: 
forms uses a driver to provide a ui specific 
interface. That interface is really just a dumb window into what I call a 
virtual form so if the user presses a key, the ui driver sends back a request 
to the virtual form saying ""interface has requested an 'a' be added to the 
current entry"". The virtual form can ignore the request, convert it to 
something else, basically do whatever it wants. If it decides to honor the 
request then it sends the ui back an event that says ""this field now contains 
<somevalue>"". Basically all the input validation is done outside the 
user interface. It would be ideal if the html interface was tied into the 
same virtual form. I realize that the individual keystrokes cannot be sent 
back in real time that the form would be passed back all at once. 
Tor-Einar thought the python script would 
obviously have to parse your XML file, and maintain the connection to the 
database somehow. James said parsing XML file would result in 
duplicating a lot of functionality and told he would 
try and write a UI driver that works with the 
existing forms backend. Forms is designed to have any type of UI put in 
front of it. We're even talking about a touch tone phone interface, however 
the ui drivers that were working up to this point have been wx(gtk) and 
curses. Tor-Einar also asked about the status of Java Interface 
(old Java forms). James informed that it's 
dead as far as I know. I'd say you could just start working on them. 
Gnue-forms is a reference implementation. People are welcome to reimplement 
in anything they want, however reimplementing forms in another language 
is going to be a major undertaking.","2003-02-12","69"
"2153","932","1","Rob Adamson (bobacus) asked what people could 
recommend for rapidly producing html 
forms that access a database? Has anyone tried running gune-forms 
in the IE with the ActiveX Python control? Peter Sullivan 
(psu) explained there have been several 
""false starts"" with an HTML client - java, javascript, php, but the 
best way forward is to write an HTML UI plug in that works the same 
as the wxPython, curses, GTK plug ins  i.e. uses as much of the normal 
forms client as poss. Main issue is that no-one has really had an 
""itch to scratch"" in this area, so no real progress so far. 

http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/HTMLClient.txt> represents 
one of our core developer's thoughts. If you have the 
interest/enthusiasm, and at least some knowledge of python I'm sure 
that getting a GNUe HTML UI up should be easier than home-brewing 
something as you have the whole of this channel to help you and it 
would be a ""big win"" for GNUe as well, and easier for you as you 
have all the rest of the GNUe infrastrcture (e.g. the database access 
and other groovy stuff in GNUe Common) rather than start from 
scratch. Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he was 
still harrassing James Thompson (jamest)
about the pieces I need for the HTML ui, 
although is someone wanted to dive in, I woudl cheerfully step aside. 
There's a few important pieces: 1) There's no concept in HTML of a fixed 
grid layout. You can use the fUgly hack that is in phpforms, but you lose all 
accessiblity, and basically don't respect the medium you're on. 2) To 
maintain good accessiblity, the labels need to be associated somehow with 
the input box. While HTML will be handy for people not wanting to use a 
client, I don't think it should be designed with PCs in mind, but more 
designed for the palmtop market. So, for inventory control and stuff, 
where the user would want to edit the form on a cellphone or other such 
portable, low screen quality device. Also, notably small screen. I also 
see the HTML UI being ideal for complying with the US (I can't remember 
which statute) requirements for accessibility. Because HTML degrades 
gracefully (when done right), it's ideal for large print, brail terminals, 
screen readers, etc. Rob noticed that HTML 
would also be useful where the users are running computers not under 
the control of the sysadmins - e.g. external services. Jeff thought 
ideally the forms client in general should be 
small and lightweight enough that someone could double client on an icon 
in a 'run from this localtion' type of deal and have it DTRT. Rob 
added - Ideally a gnue forms client would come as 
standard in windoze :) But basically *my* use of an html/web gnue forms 
client would be to simplify providing web access to a few facilities - I 
would be using it as a tool for a custom app rather than as part of a ERP 
package. Basically we have a custom 
database-driven network management system, and the network is used by 
students in their bedrooms, and is hence an unusual system, and we try 
and to our utmost to automate the common stuff to cut down on the number 
of requests to deal with manually so the usage of this web interface is 
going to be fairly light. Peter offered other solution - 
if the end-users are at all computer 
literate just use the ""normal"" Forms 
client as you could just take the normal *.exe install file include the 
forms definitions in it. Rob asked was 
there a forms client for Apple Macs? So 
Peter answered - the main forms client should 
work on Macs too, as wxPython is platform independant. I know there have 
been some discussions on the mail lists that suggest the ""should"" may be 
a bit fuxxy at the moment. Rob thought: 
I'll need a mediator between the client and 
database, because users must only be able to view records about their 
own computers. I could put this in triggers/validation rules on a 
hypothetical server-based form, or use appserver. Jeff said if 
he wants to do this soon, a server-based form 
is probably a better bet. No one had yet started coding such a UI - 
Jeff spent a lot of time thinking about it and was going over code with 
James Thompson.","2003-02-15","69"
"2154","933","1","Dan Bethe (dtm) asked is there a value and a 
possibility in structuring the Stock Keeping Units 
like this:  [seller] [client] [manager] [category1] 
[category2] [category3] [category4] [item] - with a numerical value per 
column of like 2-6 digits each. He wondered 
am i thinking about this too newbishly?  maybe an 
SKU's only job is to be unique, not to structurally identify everything.  
maybe that's just what database fields are for, and the SKU can be built 
from here, checked to see if it's unique, and then used?
Derek Neighbors, referring back to 
, 
said gnue-sb will do this - you will have 
like set of categories that 'build' a sku - you could tailor this to 
whatever need you like. Dan said his question was more generic - 
right now i'm just defining my SKU format, period.  
so regardless of what generates it (human or any given app), i wanna know 
that i'm not overloading or underloading the concept of an SKU. 
Derek was not a fan of smart numbers 
personally - but lots of people like them - i dont like them because like 
all things they degrade over time. Also, 
the larger a sku is the harder it becomes to 
memorize, the less productive it becomes to enter it etc. Using 
a structured number as Dan suggested could easily end up with 
a 20 digit sku - 8 digit sku is more 
optimal. Also, as the physical reality of your organisation changed 
over time (e.g. now more than 100 branches), these kind of ""smart"" numbers
would break and we stasrt to make 
'exceptions'. He felt it was acceptable 
to do smart numbers if you dont fully rely on them - that is you dont write 
reports based on them and such - for example its nice to select items and 
let it build you a SKU but once i sku is made if you change the elments i 
wouldnt have it auto change the sku.","2003-02-16","69"
"2155","933","2","Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) found intelligent SKU 
systems interesting.. just keep it as small as you can.. particularly if 
you're working with these numbers in the real world. 
He had used several different SKU numbering systems, but felt the easiest 
to use was where everything was converted to an 
8 digit (semi)serialized number.. I say (semi) because as they created new 
products, etc.. they tried to maintain some order so that you could say 
products in the range of xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx were 'this kind' and .. 
etc.. He felt 15 digits is too large a 
number to work with.. ""Joe Hourly, go cycle count #123456845445578 and 
#931484453612354"" - or.. ""BigCo, Inc. can I take your order?"".. ""Yes, I 
need to order 5000 #456512313843134's"" etc.. Dan said 
so it's very much a human interface thing.
Derek said that was why he preferred SKUs that were 
8 or smaller.","2003-02-16","69"

"2163","935","1","Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked about Integrating 
a wiki into a combination of Customer Relationship Management 
and DCL (Double Chocco Latte, GNUe's task management tool. 
Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said DCL / CRM 
combo is right around the corner - the CRM stuff in GNUe Small 
Business (gnue-sb) uses the table structs 
from DCL account/contact tables for dcl 1.0, which he had further 
plans for. He thought trying to link this to a wiki was a bad idea, but 
recognised that he personally doesnt like 
wiki too much (which is probably some of it). However, 
with some modifications you could 
do much of this from within DCL, using the email
and/or web interfaces to a customer. For example right now i can send an 
email and a ticket is created - the part that doesnt happen is the ability 
for me to communicate back to you via that ticket This was a common 
feature request which would be added soon.","2003-02-18","69"
"2164","935","2","Jeff said The thing that the wiki brings is 
a free form place where people can write documentation. Documentation both 
on troubleshooting steps, as well as documentation on internal servers and 
stuff. The thing I was thinking of was that a wiki-type of system might be 
nice to integrate complete documentation systems in with this. 
Derek was not convinced - he could see the need for some kind of 
""Knowledge Base""-type database, similar to those in proprietary ERP systems, 
and the GNUe Applications would need something similar. But 
wiki imho is not good for documenting 
- not horrible just not what i would choose. 
That certainly doesnt mean others might agree with you and that integrating something like that into dcl wouldnt be a horrid thing - he 
would need to think about it more i 
suppose.","2003-02-18","69"

happening for a 0.5.0 release. Am i better just trucking away on 
0.4.3 for now? Jason Cater (jcater) asked 
will you need designer? if so, you have 
no choice but 0.4.3 as the CVS version of Designer was not 
currently working. Derek said yes and 
no - i can do forms w/out designer (by writing the XML form

can"".","2003-02-19","69"

on gnue-sb. Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) asked maybe he had 
some notes or something for what 
you have in mind for gnue-sb? Derek admited he 
doesn't - the general gist of 
it is this - what a small business needs to operate done in 
gnue two tier. I would imagine a quickbooks replacement with 
more funcationality original needs were for someone else at 
had start in inventory/warehouse management. The other need 
was contact management thats why you see contact manager and 
item stuff in gnue-sb today. We were going to try to 'port' 
NOLA to gnue-sb for accounting as a start, though im not as 
convinced on that now, but its still possible. I dont want to 
build for buildings sake, i want requirements from someone 
who plans on using it. Having hard time finding someone who 
doesnt want something like yesterday, i.e. willing to go 
through a development process or who is willing to go through 
a development process and actually willling to commit time, 
i.e. we have had like 10 opportunities at this with different 
people and we usually get one of two things happening: 1. We 
dont do this full time so a solution wont be ready in 2 weeks. 
So they go elsewhere. 2. They don't have any time to put towards 
letting us know their needs so we can make something for

intended to be a generic solution for most small businesses, 
but by being involved from the start, potential users could 
help ensure it should be suitable 
to your needs (thats a plus of going first) ;) He was 
seriously ready to start bolting 
some stuff up tonight - i 
would like to work with you (and stu) to roadmap gnue-sb -

with a structure for Stock-Keeping Units (SKUs).","2003-02-21","70"
"2168","937","3","Later, Mike asked for the gnue-sb story. So Derek 
told it - We were going to 
do work for a small manufacturer that was in a bad pinch. 
We couldnt wait for appserver and 'official submission' 
processes so we made a gnue-sb, that would be less 
'controlled' but quicker to build with 2 tier only 
no appserver. The original needs were item management 
and inventory as the upfront need was warehouse 
management basically everything after the 
order was taken, i.e. they were using paypal and online 
store to get orders. They wanted to dump an order into 
system and basically have pick lists created from it for 
the warehouse bundle ship and have all shipping labels etc 
printed. Once the backend was working, redo shopping cart 
side as well as add invoicing and other things. This is 
of course a light speed overview. Anyhow they got 
impatient and have now gone through about 4 off the shelf 
products and still searching.","2003-02-21","70"
"2169","937","4","He had continued to develop gnue-sb anyway, and 
The item basics are there 
(though the sku category stuff needs to be added) it 
wouldnt be too hard to get basic inventory secondarily. 
IDEALLY gnue-sb will be perfect for people that use paper 
today as the transition can be slow and they can use 
immediately even if functionality is more minimal. One 
problem you run into 'starting' is people not wanting to 
'use' something until it has EVERY feature but its hard to 
get features when no one will use it :) Im REALLY hoping 
that you might be in a position to start using a piece at 
a time for example if we got it so just all your 
products(items) were able to be entered that is a huge 
start and if nothing else you can query your product line 
and run reports on what products you have to offer but 
then we can bring inventory online or ordering or shipping 
etc. Mike confirmed that this was his plan. Derek 
thought if that makes sense, 
so say you get products and then get customers or vendors. 
You can use them even if you are still doing invoices in 
word or whatever. I suspect if you use this you will be 
amazed at progress as two things will happen 
Firstly, development of the GNUe tools such as Forms and 
Reports would increase as the tools developers such as 
Jason Cater (jcater) and James Thompson (jamest) would 
find it easier to respond to 
'production problems' really quickly as they can relate, 
plus its encouraging for them to see it in production. 2. 
putting something in production gets features and bugs 
fixed quickly :) as motivation all around is bumped

a word processor using mail merge. 
'cause you know we can do merges

documents in word/oo, and save to a ""public"" drive - 
so I don't have to keep modifying their reports for them 
:). Derek suggested we 
get his products in db and get him using the contact 
manager - and he can at least 'fudge' invoices for a small 
while until we get an order screen up (real quick) - 
and have it make openoffice invoices with reports. 
He told Michael i really think 
within 2 or 3 weeks we can get you doing invoices in gnue

files and I got sick last week and couldn't complete, won't 
get back to it till next week said James. This broke 
all forms because stuff like ""About"" box, ""Jump to record"" box, 
error boxes no longer worked. Currently James was adding 
<dialog> support into forms which 
is the equivalant of <form style=""dialog""> which means 
<form> now can nest. You'll be able to create custom

using a relational database. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
explained that all objects are persistent when using appserver. 
In fact an object in appserver is 
more or less a database entry and a class is more or less a database 
table. It was asked whether it was possible to implement 
inheritance. Reinhard answered that 
we very much believe that we 
shouldn't do inheritance (we == some of the core project members). 
What we have as appserver ""object"" is not in the sense of OOP. We 
just call it object because it combines data (from the database) 
with code (python triggers). There were some similarities 
to OOP (private and public properties) - 
 there are properties with 
different ""permissions"", like property ""stockCount"" is read/write 
for the ""system"" but read only for the user so the user may not do 
stockCount=17, but he may use procedures like ""increaseStock(5)""

pretty sure it's a trivial addition - ilike 
support needs added to the GCondition/Datasource. Derek thought 
it probably should be a property in the

by form with a gnue.conf option (so it sets it for all forms). This would

you have 5 look up tables, i was going to make

represented as C144201? Mike told it's 
really delimited. That way I didnt literally lock myself into 2 digits per 
segment as I designed it to be. Derek offered starting with what 
was needed and adjusting form later. Im thinking 
that the delimiter will be really evil for invoicing and such, i.e. i dont 
see delimiters for much of anything on invoices and such i encounter. Maybe 
i just see them as - instead of . Mike explained since he has 
opted to make my cross references mfg.model <-> 
ref, there's a much more likely need for that segment to be 3 digits. 
Derek noticed now it seems like this will need 
to be a choice 'delimiter' or no delimiter. Im planning on making the 
categories be 6 character varchar, so if you want to use 1 digit or 6 you 
can. Im giong to make the fields big enough, but will plan on delimiting 
(not doing optoin not to) and NOT padding - non-delimited and padded
stock-keeping units can be 'second 
pass' type items :).","2003-02-28","71"

are you trying to build in some filter 
mechanism here? Very generically im thinking - six category tables with a 
segment and a desc (As well as id). Then you have your item and it has 
id cat1 cat2 cat3 cat4 cat5 cat6 which holds the segments (/me 
suspects will 'build' the number form the segments as well and store it 
in a field) even though it could be calculated (for flexibility) later on. 
I imagine some folks will want free form ability its the cross reference 
table here that is throughing me for a loop. I think i get what your 
driving at just not sure how to make it generic. Mike agreed - 
I can see this as being specific to my needs. 
But I need to have a way to correlate my #'s to my vendor's #'s. Each 
vendor has their own system but the one thing that remains true is the 
mfg's #. So I rely on that. Derek asked if he 
can clarify what you are trying to do - 
basically take manufacturer and manufacturer number and condense it to 
a smaller number, to include as a part of your sku. Mike confirmed 
that. Ok, here is what im thinking - family, 
manufacturer, mfg model are probably going to be universal. That is people 
will probably want to 'group' product types and everyone's product is 
manufactured by someone (even if its yourself). This way we can create a 
xref table as if all tables are generic we dont want to make 6 xref 
tables. Actually i guess family could still be generic. So what if i 
make manufacturer table and mfg model number (which is really an Xref 
table), then 4 generic 'category' tables - will this work for you? Of 
course manufacturer table should be more than - id, segment, desc - but 
i want to get something usable quick.","2003-02-28","71"

Lithuania and one in Argentina. Matthew asked whether all these users 
use Designer with Forms and Reports to write all of their stuff and Derek 
confirmed that. Derek also noticed, that those 
that are adopting as we speak they will be using GNUe Small Business, gnue-sb, 
mostly for backend manufacturing. It is being written as we speak so they are 
'early adopters'. Matthew explained his situation - 
my boss, many years ago, started writing an Access 
app to do some of the mgmt of this company. It's now blown out, and I was hired 
(mostly) to convert it to something more reliable. Since a 300MB chunk of Access 
data doesn't scale real well. 
Derek offered using a tool, called pgadminII -  it 
will quickly convert your access to postgres. You can then use gnue wizards to 
make forms from those tables VERY quickly. The only real work you will have to 
do that isnt 'busy' work is the 'code' to do 'special' things. All data handling 
will be handled for you.","2003-03-01","71"
"2183","944","1","Derek Neighbors (grassHopper) said that GNUe Small Business was 
not ready for prime time usage - 
0.1 should be out shortly but it will be product management and 
contact management in a base form - you can grab the cvs.
There was a createdb.sql script for PostgreSQL which needed to 
be run, then setup your 
connections.conf file to point to dbname with gnue_sb as the
connection name, and start running 
the forms - all forms under 'item' directory should work at this 
point except item_maint.gfd. It was asked whether each 
form had to be run seperately. Christian Selig (lupo) asked if 
there were any navigator files in 
current gnue-sb?? Derek said 
not functioning ones -
you have to run gnue-forms 
filename.gfd as of time of writing.","2003-03-04","71"
"2184","945","1","Nicholas Lee (esands) suggested that GNUe Small Business should 
Target sql-ledgers feature set.  Except 
for a few niggles it does the job.  Ignore SL's schema and 
code. Derek Neighbors (derek) disagreed - 
i would be much more likely to start 
with NOLA - /me assumes people liking sql-ledger will like it and 
GNUe isnt for them - those wishing to have something they can 
extend and has clean data structures will look for gnue-sb.
He felt sql-ledger was very nice for 
the market that is using it - it certainly is more functional than 
gnue-sb as of time of writing and
there is something to be said for working code :)
However, he felt the inability to 
reconcile a ledger indicated a different target audience.","2003-03-05","71"
"2185","946","1","Derek Neighbors (Derek) asked whether readonly dialog had not been 
finished or if it was the final version. Because as of time of writing 
they did not look like error messages. James Thompson (jamest)

them to make look like real error boxes.","2003-03-06","72"
"2186","946","2","Later, Anthony Lenton (aa) said he had some patches, but as he was 
not working on the *latest* 0.5, could 
already be changed/fixed). Jason Cater (jcater) noted that 
cvs head has changed a lot recently. 
Mainly UIdriver system, bugfixes, lots of rearranging. James said 
the biggest change will be you can do 
<dialogs> now that work which I think will probably replace 
some custom stuff you had to do in that last patch cluster you sent 
us. Most of the internal dialogs 
now use the new setup (all but login dialog). You can find examples in 
forms/src/dialogs. So you can do custom dialogs a few different ways. 
You can define them in .gfd files or gfd libraries, or if you want to 
bundle a custom gnue-forms you can add directories under 
forms/src/dialogs and follow that format - forms can't tell the 
difference where they came from.. Anthony was interested 
how does the caller know the outcome of 
the dialog? James explained - dialogs 
are modal and have a parameters dict passed into them. They manipulate 
that dict which you can then check.","2003-03-06","72"

wanted a point release of appserver with the release of

also planning to do a non-major release of reports at the same time. 
Reinhard explained this depends on 
whether i can get hold of Jan Ischebeck (siesel) as
I have some points i have to decide 
w/ him before any further release of appserver because this decision 
could break compatibility and i don't want a release and break it a 
week afterwards.","2003-03-07","72"
"2188","948","1","Derek Neighbors (revDeke) wanted to check some previous work he had done on 
item pricing which recorded both a 'cost' and a 'base price' for an item. 
every one of their customers had own item and 
price list (this is likely more 'distributor' oriented than 'retail' oreinted). 
The concept is I might offer 800 products, but to customer A only 100 of them 
might be available for purchase and customer A might pay more than customer B 
for item xyz, so basically pricing is set at 'customer' level. Most 
customers would default to the default price, but other customers might get 
preferential discounts. Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) thought 
the best way to do it, is to have simply a 'price' 
field in the item table. Then there should be a discounts table (or whatever 
you wanna call it) which references the products in the product table and has 
a qty and price. Then when needing a price for a product - 
the discount table would need to be checked.. 
and if no discount item or if the qty ordered were less than that in the 
discount table the price from the item table would be used.","2003-03-10","72"
"2189","948","2","Derek said that, if people did not want to use something this complicated, 
they could simply have the same discount rate (which might be 0%) for all 
customers. Also, he noted that discounts would probably be related to the 
total volumes being ordered over time by a customer, not necessarily the 
volume of a particular product on a particular order. Mike agreed - he was 
aware of wholesalers who had a piece price, dozen 
price, and case price and a secret '4th line' price they give to the high 
volume accounts which is a bit better than their published 'case 
pricing' Derek said as long as we add 
ability to do 'customer' based discounts - you can do 'volume discount' 
and then compare that to the 'customer' discount 
(if one exists) and take the lower of the two.","2003-03-10","72"
"2190","948","3","Derek felt that this level of sophistication on pricing was where
the shrink wrap stuff SERIOUSLY falls down on 
its face - the more agile you can be with 
your pricing the more effective you can be. It was not unknown for 
gas stations/petrol stations to change price several times a day.","2003-03-10","72"

having trouble with them :(. At least 5 people have made comments 
like ""i did apt-get install dcl, now what the hell do i

perhaps this weekend. Derek 
offered that if Jeff had not got time to do config stuff, he 
could provide like a one paragraph 
post install instruction list and have the deb pop up that blue 
deb screen that says ... you need to to the following <insert

"2193","951","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked Reinhard Müller (Reinhard) whether 
he had any ideas to change the API to make 
it XMLRPC conform. Reinhard admitted he didn't know 
what xmlrpc defines and what not, 
what data types xmlrpc knows. If all else fails we could concatenate 
all strings of the table together and define column dividors, row 
dividors and an escape character, and pass it as a single string 
like. Jan hoped there would be no need to go that far.","2003-03-14","73"
"2194","951","2","After looking at the specs at xmlrpc.org Jan found a structure 
type, that would mean, that we could still 
use our api. Reinhard raised a question - 
we defined the result of fetch being 
a 2-dimensional array, but you impelemented it as an array of 
dictionaries. I guess we must at least switch to the 2-dimensional 
array for xmlrpc conformance. I'm not sure if a struct helps 
us. Jan found out that difference 
between API documentation: (2dim array) and implementation (2dim 
dictionary). He was thinking what would be easier to implement. 
Reinhard offered looking for what would be easier to transport, because 
implementation would be no big difference.","2003-03-14","73"
"2195","952","1","It was asked what two-tier and three-tier meant. Christian Selig (lupo) 
said in two-tier mode, you have layout and 
software logic on the client side and the database on the server side - 
in three-tier, you have layout on the client, software logic stored in an 
application server and the database on a server - through an intelligent 
driver model, gnue is able to operate in both modes although, as 
of time of writing, 2-tier was the most advanced/usable. It was asked 
whether GNUe could be used for a customer and address database.
Christian said this is quite realistic - 
of course, right now you have to write the application for yourself, based 
on the gnue tools.","2003-03-14","73"
"2196","952","2","It was asked if GNUe supported custom widgets,
such as a calander/date selector. Christian noted that there was already 
- or would be - support for input masks, but further widgets could be 
written using python. Derek Neighbors (revDeke) said 
the team is trying to make it more plausible 
to 'easily' plug in new custom widgets - like 'search' boxes, date 
pickers. Jason Cater (jcater) emphasised that 
custom widgets are *not encouraged - but will be 
supported at some point. Derek agreed - 
it puts you in a bad position of having a 
'custom' (read non supported) framework - what we generally ask is if there 
is somethign you do not see ask - i think in most cases there is sufficient 
comprimise made to get 'functionality' into the framework - that avoids the 
need for 'custom' components. Jason emphasised that 
GNUe is not a GUI framework... it's a data 
manipulation and reporting framework Derek said that GNUe 
encouraged people to ask the developers 'how 
can i do 'X' - and see if they can provide an answer by extending existing 
widgets. Sometimes the answer will be 'we have no intention to support X'
- in which case likely gnue isnt a good choice for the application at 
hand, emphasising gnue is not glade - 
it is specific to database productivity applications - /me wouldnt write a 
cdplayer, webbrowser or image editor with gnue framework :) 
Because GNUe chose to support a myriad of platforms 
from curses to gtk to qt to html to you name it - e limit ourselves to a much 
more concise 'widget' catalog. He felt that a customer/address 
database would be a 'no brainer' gnue type 
application i.e. its kind of thing gnue was made for. He thought 
its reasonable for us to support 'calendar' date 
picker entry fields - /me notes we dont currently, but i think it would be 
feasible request.","2003-03-14","73"
"2197","952","3","He also suggested looking at GNUe Small Business, 
which already had contact manager functionality - 
that probably fits to a small degree the first

database.","2003-03-14","73"

anything else additional to the ""GNUe-Tools-0.4.3-setup-debug-on.exe""

"2199","953","2","After installation Anil could not not understand ""Editor for 
connection"". This was called via Start Menu -> Programs -> 
GNUe -> GNUe Connections. Arturas explained that 
this is to define your connection 
to the database. Anil queried where he could 
 find the db scripts to create the 
necessary schemas. Arturas explained that 
you create database yourself, that 
is you use gnue forms to connect to your database and to work with 
already existing there data. He explained 
if you know what you need, you can 
manually create base schema and then connect gnue to it, then work 
with data. Gnue is not the tool to create db schemas. Anil 
asked how to configure connection to a 
database whose SID is say ""testsid"" and 
the host is say ""testhost"" and on port ""1521"". Arturas said 
that at first you'll have to give some 
name for this connection (Connection name). Then the database 
type went in the Provider field (). 
Then you'll need host and port. 
Encoding field could be left empty and both rpc type and transport 
were only needed for appserver. To ""Submit"" the form it should be

there are several companies interested

Jason Cater (jcater) said we'll need to extend 
it at some point to support images stored in a database, but 
there was a general consenus that most real-world uses (at least 
initially) would be for images stored outside of a database. However, 
James said he had put in type=""pil""

Python Imaging Library (PIL). He had developed 
this initial level of image support to provide a simple mechanism for

to the common 0.4.3 branch as well 
as the CVS HEAD branch (what would eventually become 0.5.0). Reinhard

interface should be stable - however johannes is working on breaking 
recursion between class repository and language interface. For the 
introspection part i'd rather use the business objects - not the class 
repository. Jan said I thought of 
accessing the class repository through the special style business

release of GNUe Small Business soon, and was 
hoping to have 0.2.x ready by the time 
0.5.x of the tools is out - to give some incentive for people to beat 
on the tools. There is a lot missing from the roadmaps he had 
done for GNUe-SB, but i suspect to keep 
feature sets minimal and releases often (hopefully).","2003-03-25","74"
"2209","959","2","Further to 
, he suggested 
item has 'base price' - then as you state 
some sort of tiered pricing table - likely by volume discount - then 
there is 'customer' price discounts - and the derivation of price is 
the lowest of the two. /me suspects we can make it even more complicated 
than that - but i suppose thats suitably complex to start with. 
Mike Vincent(Vee2d2) said that fits 
my needs, but actuall my needs arent even that complex - as the 'customer' 
price will be one of the tiered prices, I would just like to be able to 
specify that DerekCo(tm) gets tier 2 or better regardless of volume ordered.. 
etc. Derek felt that might be simpler to implement - previously he 
had seen systems where the discount was only 
negotiated at customer level up front - so 
didnt matter if you bought 1 or 100 of something. However, 
different products might have different discounts per customer as 
well - so say you are a big customer 
of mine - and you buy lots of product A - but not much 
product B - and A and B are manufacturered by two different people - 
i might give you deep discount on A but not B. Mike agreed - 
similar issues can arise if I have to source 
through a different vendor for one reason or another. freight can be a big 
factor too - but I see these issues as concerns when setting my base 
prices. Derek noted that, in some cases, there might need to be a 
minimum order quantity for a product.","2003-03-25","74"
"2210","959","3","Later on, Derek was reviewing an accounting proposal he had been 
sent, and was comparing it to the schemas in acclite (GNUe's fork of 
NOLA) and aria (another fork of NOLA, as discussed in

as well as the original proposal for GNUe Financials 
on the website. 
James Thompson (jamest) asked what all 
is in gnue-sb now? more than contact mgmnt? Derek said 
product management and contact management 
mostly. The product management was 
pre inventory control - basically 
defining what products you have, setting pricing etc. 
There was more information on the GNUe SB 
website. 
He suspects we need a link on gnue site 
to gnue-sb - as many people are amazed we have information 
available. He would also try to put a redirect from the 
GNUe SB website that dated back to when it had been considered a 
non-GNU project.","2003-03-25","74"
"2211","959","4","Derek noted that the accounting proposal he had been sent 
did not mention Accounts Receivable (AR) - the invoices mentioned 
appeared to be Accounts Payable (AP), which he though of as linked to 
Purchase Orders. This was confirmed, but AR would be needed 
at some point. AP and purchase order would be linked, but not 
every AP invoice would have a PO (exceptions would include 
items like utility bills and rents). Derek asked about 
invoice classes - i see its way 
to group invoices - probably for reporting. It was 
explained that these were needed as a way of segregating 
invoices imported from external feeder systems. Derek 
wondered is this really an 'invoice' 
thing or should it be part of the chart of accounts? 
However, this was not the case - although it might be a field 
on the vendor table rather than stored against each invoice.","2003-03-25","74"
"2212","959","5","Derek said that he was planning to avoid some of the packaging 
issues with GNUe SB by saying its not 
'modules' you get the whole damn shooting match. This would 
be OK, as long as each module was not required in order to 
use the others.","2003-03-25","74"
"2213","959","6","Derek noted that previous discussion had established that 
items being purchased might need to record both 
manufacturers and vendors 
as goods would often be bought from wholesalers rather than 
directly from the manufacturer - where items were bought direct,
the manufacturer would also be set up as a vendor. He also 
talked about the difference between fical and calendar years - 
many companies might have Period 01 start in June or July. 
He also asked about ""closing"" a period in General Ledger, to 
prevent any more transactions being posted to the period or 
the year. It was noted that some versions of Microsoft Great 
Plains would not let you work on the new year until the old 
year was closed - as this could take several weeks at some 
companies, they had to do manual cheques and then enter them 
retrospectively later.","2003-03-25","74"
"2214","959","7","Derek compared the accounting proposal he had been sent 
to acclite - acclite seemed to 
encompass about everything you 
had only have additional information He was 
curious to see what arias has 
done (best i can tell they didnt 'add stuff') just fixed 
bugs. Mike asked whether Derek was 
looking at these other projects 
for a frame of reference, or with intent of maintaining some 
sort of interoperability? Derek said 
possibly either ;) - 
originally the idea was to use 
NOLA's structures - submit the changes back to them and let 
people use the php interface if they so desired. nola was a 
MESS layout wise in cvs - so jcater refactored it so it was 
logical and converted it to postgres - that is acclite. 
arias seems to have done same thing only made a project out 
of it - so i would be willing to see how much they 
had changed the NOLA code, and whether it was worth trying 
to make GNUe SB compatible with it - 
i suspect ap/ar/gl wise we 
could. Having downloaded the arias CVS, he noted that 
they kept that horrible nola 
structure with virutally 
hunderds of php files all in same directory, and 
had the same problems as NOLA with including some 
(presumably) non-redistributable font files.","2003-03-25","74"

James Thompson (jamest) was not sure that there existed any

not seem to have a copyright at all and Jason said that 
in the US, then, it has an implicit

thought that under international 
multilateral contracts, a restrictive copyright is

the idea of having a minitoot

having to follow links to reference material/sites then come 
back to the dev guide, and go back, then come back.. etc.. 
allows for a single point of reference while digging into 
GNUe goodies, real convenient. Jason added he 
had intended on the tutorial to be 
from the point of view of writing triggers, so it wouldn't 
necessarily cover all aspects of python, just enough to write 
useful triggers. Derek Neighbors (Derek) agreed with 
that - i definitely agree. A 
trigger tutorial that covers the 'basics' of python is great.  
As the guy that tries to sell this thing to people one of 
the things i like to tout is that you can write data driven 
applicatiosn with little or no code, being able to show very 
quickly how to do basic things is a huge plus, for example,  
launching another form or other things.","2003-03-25","74"

at compiere (the 'open source' financials package previously 
discussed in

had the version of the Oracle database needed to view it. He was not 
impressed with the licensing model for something that was meant to be 
free software - to get Print to PDF support
requires a $50/user license - to get a data migration tool (to 
upgrade from older version) requires a support contract. 
Also, they've canceled postgresql migration
""due to lack of embedded transactions"" - something which, 
as a long-time Oracle user, he had never heard 
of - but they did say if the users
want to raise the money to pay a professional to implement a java-level 
transaction engine - they would support it after it's written.

angle for them.","2003-03-25","74"

of something would be ungood - but this is a 0.1.0 release, so it's 
really only for the brave (=CVS-aware) anyway. Jason Cater

very much into release early release 
often - basically if the contact 
manager works under 0.5.0 - and the few items hanging out on item 
managemetn work under 0.5.0 then 
there are two useful pieces for gnue-sb
- which is sufficient release to bottle up and let escape. Also there 
are a large number of folks that are afraid of cvs - but dont mind 
playing. /me figures currently a release consists of a few liner notes
and tar ball so its not like a ton of effort would go into a release 
at this stage.","2003-03-27","75"

maybe we should use the strategy to 
only put the very basic settings into gnue.conf - everything appserver 
_needs_ to run - but not more. This was because 
because things in gnue.conf are rather

if you have a few entries with rows=""x"" -

- you can NOT save the record because all the save buttons/menus/etc have 
been disabled. I assume on 'insert' it re enables them - but going past last

them.","2003-04-01","75"

the goal is that forms/reports/designer

for Application server as i have a massive 
legacy application that needs to be reworked into a modern architecture
- i'd like to put as much as possible into a middle tier. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) admitted that 
appserver unfortunately has much less 
progress than i would want it to have but James said 
one thing that would help though is having 
someone like you using it - I know forms/reports/common are driven by 
jcater and my needs - and sometimes even a user request.
Reinhard agreed - one thing that would 
help though is somebody that kicks my ass on a daily basis.
Henry volunteered to help, saying i have to 
get more familiar w. python - :> it seems pretty transparent.
James explained the principles behind the copyright assignment of all

that is the 'commit' doesnt enable until you exit a field on the 
new record (which is way better than it not enabling until you exit 
the record itself). He personally considered 
it fixed, but wanted that side 
note. The other bug - foreign 
key populating all lookups is _not_ fixed - instead of it populating 
with the value being committed on commit, it now populates with the 
previous record on commit. This was with the 9th set of

you can solve the foriegn key one and do a pre10 (along with your fixes

the countries datasource, and create a dropdown entry. 
There was an example of this in the connection.gfd (GNUe Forms

Ability to set parent/child relations between customers and 
master parent price lists. I'd consider that all basic

some nice features would be 
'scheduled' price levels for temporary discounts - 
Also a similar mechanism would be 
useful to scheduling permenant price changes. 
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) suggested So 
if we added say a start date / end date fields to the tiered 
pricing table eg: id, sku, qty, from_date, until_date, price 
then that would satisfy your needs? Nicholas noted 
that Pricing is one of the most 
complex parts of business. 8) Anything that can be done to 
improve management would be well received. Mike 
pointed out, however, that we're 
trying to keep things simple at this stage - 
I think the focus is to have 
something from which we can later come back and build on.
Nicholas felt it was important even at this stage to 
think about normalising the pricing 
schema away from the stock information and stock levels.  
However, dealing with discounts based on i) qty breaks, 
ii) time periods, iii) specific customers, iv) payment basis 
(ie. cash discounts), v) operator selected.   All different 
things that require some addition information.

a few different things - and all of our tools are designed to work

simple client/server setup say a graphical front end to a database 
you can grab forms and write the xml files by hand. If you want a 
middle tier w/ business objects you grab appserver and define your 
objects in there. Forms has a appserver interface so it'll not 
really know the difference - it's still just a datasource. 
Appserver/forms communicate over gnue common's rpc abstraction 
library - but I know little about it. Jan Ischebeck (siesel)

if not, Jan could try to write a 
proposal and post it to gnue-dev to get comments/changes 
etc. Derek said he would still like to do the first 
draft - he felt that he and Jan had different ideas about 
Integrator, with Jan seeing it as just an extension of 
Application Server. Derek's view was that it was more closely 
releated to Reports and Common, much of which would be reused.
In the meantime, the two biggest 
things you could do to help integrator is develop a rock solid 
ascii driver and a rock solid xml driver for common/dbdrivers - 
as those will be the two biggest data types folks will 
use with Integrator (in 
my experience). James Thompson (jamest) noted that 
he and Jason Cater (jcater) had talked 
about reports/integrator a little - at one time we talked about 
the possibility of changing the way reports handles some things
so that it would almost be integrator - especially 
since reports has a plugin output 
system. Derek said that Reports was already capable of 
doing the output side of Integrator - 
the big problem is the 'import' 
side is not there - so i can have a datasourceX - and use reports 
to pump it out to xml formated however i want - but i dont have 
a way 'in reports' to import that data back in. I think the two 
things 'integrator' needs to do is provide that import mechanism
and provide a ui to do 'mappings' - whether that needs to be a 
separate tool from reports i am not sure.","2003-04-12","77"

agnostic way to create the definitions? that get stored in the

have a form for class management.","2003-04-14","77"

appserver will have a way of 
""bootstrapping"" the very basic table definitions for the tables
that hold the classes and properties and so on - those basic 
definitions will be written in a .ini file. That .ini file will 
be read by appserver and appserver will ""bootstrap"" the database

AppServer, called GEAS (GNU Enterprise Application Server). For 
the new version, the intention was to support multiple formats, 
including .gcd but also XML, ODL (Object Database Language) or 
whatever people wanted to write a driver for. He explained 
we started to dislike .gcd as we 
learned that most businessmen won't be able to understand that syntax

of experience in C or a comparable language - but not for a 
businessman. However adding a new property to a class with a visual form
will be easy even for Joe Accountant :) - especially if the prpoerty 
maintenance form looks similar to the customer maintenance.

its drawbacks - my current project involves replacing a system that was 
TOO friendly - any user could make arbitrary changes to database schema

primary focus is getting appserver

definitions. With GNUe's architecture, 
the abstraction of db schema maintenance

of the gfd file 1. on the fly (by a cgi script) 2. direktly after a changing 
the gfd files 3. by the javascript client itself. James Thompson 
(jamest) asked should a quick hack be part 
of designer?  or a seperate script altogther - 
it sounds like it works nothing like the other 
wizards. Jan explained that the reason 
for adding it to designer was, that its much more difficult to write a 
seperate script than writing a wizard - In 
its form its  a bit similar to the ""create Schema"" Wizard, which is 
disabled as of time of writing because 
of schema definition changes, I think. Later, he said he had 
changed the name to ""Compile for jsForms"" and 
the entry in the menu to ""Extras|Compile Form for GNUe JsForms' - hope 
that makes it more clear.","2003-04-29","79"

we haven't done too much since the last release

unstable - we don't have recent ones for woody, the Debian 
stable distribution as of time of writing. Umeboshi said
that he had been doing work along similiar lines
- but i'd rather ditch most of what i've done - and learn the gnue system 
and port some of my stuff to it. All of my work prevoiusly has been in 
python, pygtk, pypgsql, mxtools, kjbuckets - kjbucktets has a nice 
graph object which has worked well for me. He explained 
it is sets and graphs for python. His 
code had been used by a high-volume eBay reseller.","2003-05-01","80"

need to be backpoted too. He asked 
have you heard of 
pyro - python remote objects?
it's pure python, and it allows you to distribute python objects across 
networks. it's pretty neat, but it can't distribute c modules only pure

Some days later, Dmitry said he had tested the native Win32 Forms driver - 
he had got a login screen but was not ablr to load 
a real form. Tamás made some changes, which fixed this. He asked 
Dmitry (and anyone else) to please test it with 
your (home made) forms in general, if have a little time. Dmitry wondered 
if his initial problems were because i use custom 
authentication with postgres. Tamás said he had 
tested with netrc on firebird only.","2003-05-02","80"

No module named ImageWin. Tamás said it 
needs Pil for <image> support. 
Bajusz warned calculating 
widgetWidth/widgetHeight was not perfect yet, but he had worked around 
this by using pointSize = 18 in my gnue.conf 
and using Courier as a fixed width font. He believed that 
the win32 driver has the same ""entry width not 
accurate"" bug as wx has.","2003-05-02","80"

The next day, Dmitry confirmed it was much 
better with last setting you suggested - now 
it looks the same as undex linux (wx driver). He reported 
search buttons (they call simpleQuery) work - 
one that activate dialog does not. Tamás said 
this is true on linux too - dialogs are not perfect 
yet. He was not happy with the way dialogs were handled 
now the form reads/builds all dialogs when it 
starts - but what if i have about 100 
dialogs in my program - i never want to 
load all dialogs when i start 1 form. Dmitry suggested that 
standart dialogs shows how to do that 
in another way - this could just be extended 
for user defined dialogs - or are they load at start time anyway? 
Tamás thought this was the case.","2003-05-02","80"
"2260","986","5","Tamás said he had been converting an application to GNUe, but had 
stopped because of the frustrations of using the wx driver on Microsoft 
Windows, and put his effort into writing the native Win32 driver instead. 
Dmitry asked does win32gui module free from 
all wx limits you faced? Tamás thought so - 
it needs more work (when coding), because i 
use win32 API, not MFC - but this gives full control in event handling - and 
eliminates a plus abstraction layer. I think  the forms (in general) 
ready to start reimplement my app, the main problem is reports. I 
desperately need a wisual designer - nearly all my reports changes from 
year2year.","2003-05-02","80"

or I believe you could put them in a forms library and import them.
Dmitry asked would it be useful to have 
separate directory for user defined dialogs?. James said it 
would not take much to add - but I'm not sure 
if it confuses the issue if we've already got import support w/ form 
libraries. He was worried that there would be 
too many places to do the same thing - 
in the forms itself, in a user defined forms library, in a special directory 
just for user forms. Dmitry asked then 
what is the user defined forms library, may be i'm missing important

is fired once each time a form (dialog) is called, on activation 
runs each time a form is displayed - it is convenient
to clear the fields from the last time it was 
called.","2003-05-08","81"

the best way is to ask - as we have lots 
of scheduled improvements, but were ameanable to 
up the schedule of things planned where there was specific user demand, 
or to accept submitted patches into the core product rather than force users 
to 'customize'. For Neil's specific 
problem, Derek noted that, where there were multiple pages of tickets, you 
could click on any of the 'column headings' - 
it should 'sort' by that column heading AND make it all in one page. /me

0.9.3 either.","2003-05-16","82"
"2271","993","3","Neil also needed a way to merge tickets 
together - is this planned? Derek said that the way he handled 
duplicate tickets was to close one of them, and in the ""reason for closure"" 
put a cross-reference to the other ticket in the format dcl://ticket/23423, 
which DCL would turn into a hyperlink to the other ticket. Neil said his 
problem was slightly different - we have one email 
address for all issue reports - because the email addr gets routed to 7 or 
8 people they reply - so we have many reponses to one issue. 
Derek suggested setting up the e-mail gateway so that any e-mails sent 
to the gateway's e-mail address gets a ticket 
made automagically - now 10 people can have 'watches' on that ticket - 
but if they respond to the ticket they should be logging to that 
ticket. Neil thought this sounded useful, as 
we are in transition, we have several management 
types that just want to respond to email and not 
get into the details of DCL. Derek said 
he had similar issues with some of his end users - 
and i am using an OLD version so can't use 
gateway just yet - so i can feel some of that pain. He felt 
the hardest part of something like dcl is 
getting people to use it - once you get them using it and fluent they 
scream bloody murder when you take it away Neil hoped so,

This was the normal Remote Procedure Call (RPC) method in the Debian 
stable distribution of GNU/Linux. He noted that this defult would only 
apply where no config file exists (or 
the option is not mentioned in config file). Jan Ischebeck (siesel) 
recommended leaving the pw_xmlrpc driver as 
default option, because its the only one working on windows in server 
mode and its included in the default python distro - 
new in python 2.2 ;). Reinhard 
noted he was currently using python 2.1 - he was torn between having 
a default that did not work on Debian stable and having a default that 
did not work on Microsoft Windows. Jan suggested 
what about a fall back list? 
Reinhard was not sure how this would work. Jan said that this would be 
similar to the fall back mechanism already in the database drivers.
Jason Cater (jcater) explained 0.5.0 introduced 
a fallback mechanism - if you say provider=oracle it tries the
various Oracle database drivers in turn - likewise 
w/postgres, etc - it may not be working perfectly as this was the first

for rpc driver fallback as 
well.","2003-05-26","83"

affected, all lists affected, all lists that 'fit' affected, or 
we add a parameter to tell which list 
should be affected. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked what the difference 
between the second and third options was. Reinhard gave an example - 
list 1 has all german customers - and list 
2 has all u.s. customers - if i

COMMIT - If a commit happens, the new record is inserted (remote) and its 
new gnue_id should be added to its representation in the local 
cache. However, Reinhard pointed out that 
after the commit the record stays in 
the list on client side, doesn't it? and it would disappear on server 
side - so client list and server list will be out of sync - which could 
lead to a mess when for example fetching further (previously unfetched) 
records. He still preferred the fourth option, even if 
form's dbdriver could ""hide"" the 
drawbacks of the first option.","2003-05-26","83"
"2293","1007","4","Jan did not like the fourth 
option, as it makes our simple API too 
complicated. He preferred the third option, but Reinhard felt 
this would cause similar problems with keeping client and server 
in sync to the first option, and there 
might be states where the ""original conditions"" aren't even defined - for 
example when you just opened a form and inserted a record without 
selecting something first. Jan noted that the nearest equivalent 
to this ""multiple list"" problem in a normal relational 
database to this was a cursor - and I had 
a look in the postgres user manual and there is no way to 
insert a record into a cursor or remove a record from a cursor. 
Reinhard concluded that this meant the first option was 
exactly what a pure database would 
do - but he felt that we at 
least want to be _better_ than a database :-). He suggested 
reconsidering this later.","2003-05-26","83"

Jason was not sure - he thought Bajusz Tamás (btami) had 
added some native ps generation but Jason 
himself was now working on the next generation markup 
- based on styles, etc. However,it's got a 
ways to go before useful and he was concentrating on Designer at the 
moment. But he noted that reports can output docbook 
directly - I've been meaning to add an example report to that effect - but 
I'm having to learn docbook at the same time.","2003-05-27","83"
"2297","1009","1","James Thompson (jamest) announced that 0.5.1 is 
out real soon now. The ui driver work alone was worth a release. He 
said there was pending buglist cleanup on designer 
- i really wanted to get input masks in there too but I have yet to start 
work on them so I'd say that aint going to happen. Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) noticed it would be nice to fix the .deb's 
before 0.5.1 so it would be possible to use the realeased versions for
the Debian packages. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) also noticed it would be good 
if Jeff could package the actual cvs instead of 
the 0.5.0 release. Derek Neighbors (derek)  disagreed with the 
discussion: we made a CONSCIENCE decision to not 
bundle cvs several months back. We need to get 'off' using cvs if we want 
people to use stuff in production and we want stuff in woody. If we want to 
package a 'cvs' version we need to do separate cvs packages (in the form of 
snapshots), but i dont think its worth the time unless its automated. 
Jeff said he could setup automated snapshot packages, but wondered if 
anyone would actually use them? Jan thought this possibly would be 
needed short before a new release.","2003-05-29","84"
"2298","1009","2","Later, James said he would like debs working 
for 0.5.1 as well - i wouldn't use snapshots. Derek agreed with him - 
as long as we are current on releases im 
happy. Jan would like to use snapshots 
for pre 0.5.1 versions, as I don't think that it makes sense to package 
0.5.0 without any patches - IMHO its important to have debs to test BEFORE 
the 0.5.1 version is out, rather than to have to fix bugs for the release 
first and than have to fix bugs in debs afterwards. He 
never wanted OFFICIAL debian packages from cvs, 
rather than snapshots to do developing and testing Jeff explained - 
I'm not thinking official debs, but snapshots that 
I could post on people.debian.org. If I did that, i'd prefer to make them 
only for sid, though (and they'd never be uploaded to the main 
archive). Jan agreed that SID would be 
ok for me.","2003-05-29","84"
"2299","1009","3","
Some days later, Jan was interested in progress on GNUe packaging. 
Jeff said he haven't had a chance to 
sit down with James as of time of writing. Jan asked 
where he could get latest debian packaging diffs. Jeff thought he had 
that thing setup for apt-get source. I've been using 
DBS packaging, so it's not suitable to keep them in CVS. He was 
going to update the GNUe Debian packages to use the 
dbs tarball functionality - this would be easier to work with, and 
open up the possibility of producing automated Debian packages from CVS. 
At that point I could more easily integrate the 
packaging into GNUe's own CVS again, but he personally was not keen 
on this - in principle, all the fiddling in the debian/ 
directories was really the responsibility of the Debian 
maintainer, not the ""upstream"" developers of the underlying software. 
Jan felt the only advantage of having debian 
directories in cvs is that its easier to apply changes etc..","2003-05-29","84"
"2300","1010","1","Further to previous discussions about using SAB-DB as a back-end 
database for GNUe in various threads (including 
), 
Jason Cater (jcater) noted all this negativity 
around the 
SAP-DB 
license change - lots of fud 
(fear, uncertainty, doubt). Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) felt that 
SAP-DB went about it all wrong. the more i 
see the change and talk to SAP, the more I _like_ the change. My 
understanding is that they will continue to own SAP-DB and develop it. 
They are jsut 'sub licensing' it to MySQL AB - and MySQL AB will 
add some 'features/fluff' and put under a different license and try 
to make money on it. In doing so SAP-DB has become protective 
(in a good way) and made the whole shooting match GPL - 
instead of just the engine (so they can continue to make money sub 
licensing). Thtis to me is good news not bad news - my original 
understanding is they were selling SAP-DB to MySQL and never touching it 
again, but it looked now as if this was not the case. Some 
of the complaints were from people who objected that they had 
made the client libraries GPL (instead of 
LGPL as they used to be), but the strong copyleft of the full 
GNU General Public License (as opposed to the weaker Lesser GPL) 
would actually encourage people to release SAP-DB-based products as 
free software. The discussions drifted into a general discussion of 
the merits of the existing MySQL database system, including issues like 
scalability, views and sub-selects.","2003-05-30","84"
"2301","1011","1","Chan Min Wai (dcmwai) said he was the 
developer of arias, 
a fork of the NOLA software, previously discussed in several threads, including 
. 
Dmitry Sorokin (ra3vat) noted that it was discussed 
at one time to use nola db schema for gnue accounting, but he was not 
sure what the outcome of this had been. Looking at the screenshots for aria, 
Dmitry felt they may be easily converted to gnue 
forms. Chan felt that gnue proved to be more 
customizable but that arias just need a web 
browser as a client, as the application was written in PHP with MySQL 
as the back-end database. Dmitry noted that, as of time of writing, 
gnue is mostly a set of tools - 
we just do not have official gnue applications 
like acounting. Chan was thinking maybe I can 
intreged gnue to arias so that when having web access can also have gnue 
access as well.","2003-06-01","84"
"2302","1011","2","
Some days later, Derek Neighbors (derek) said that some of the GNUe 
developers had snarfed the NOLA tree sometime ago
- and redid their structure - and fixed a lot of the bugs - and put in private 
cvs under the name acclite with the intention of porting 
it to the GNU Enterprise Framework. More 
recently, he had looked at arias and considered using it as the basis for GNUe 
Small Business (gnue-sb), but had not gone any further with this - gnue-sb 
was going really well until real life hit me 
:( Chan asked if the changes from NOLA to acclite had included any 
fixes to Inventory - he was looking at this area next, and would prefer not to 
have to re-fix anything that the GNUe developers had already fixed. Derek 
said they had not really looked at Inventory - the priority had been to convert 
it to use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL, and then a few bugs in the accounting. 
This first priority had taken quite a bit of work, as NOLA took full 
advantedge of the non-standard features of MySQL (e.g. assigning NULL to a 
primary key).","2003-06-01","84"
"2303","1011","3","Derek admitted he was not really keen on web applications, especially for 
Financials, and had been looking to 'clean up' NOLA as a prelude to converting 
it to the GNU Enterprise framework (i.e. using Forms, Reports and Navigator).
Chan asked if the GNUe developers would consider contributing their patches 
in acclite to arias. Derek said that, if the directory structure was fixed and 
PostgreSQL support added to arias, he personally would 
gladly do all future fixes on ARIAS and would consider working directly with 
ARIAS on schemas - he could even envisage gnue-sb and arias as 
complementary projects (gnue-sb using the GNUe Tools and arias using PHP) 
sharing the same schema. ultimately we could have 
ARIAS use the web UI of the GNU Enterprise Framework - it just isnt ready 
yet. He explained that the concept of GNUe was 
a framework - so you write one ""form"" - and instantly 
(without code modifications) it will run on curses (text based ui), win32, mac, 
gtk2, qt, html etc - just our 'html' client isnt ready yet.","2003-06-01","84"
"2304","1011","4","Chan said he wasn't keen on the NOLA directory structure either, but that 
we don't have time to clean all that creep/ - 
so we plan to clean up the creep on the rewrite... and For the time being, I 
will just stick to the old structure and fix all bug. Once a Stable release 
is being release... A rewrite will begain... Derek wondered if it 
might be easier to apply the patches from arias to acclite - 
and have postgres support and a clean dir structure 
with minial work - but im not pushing that. Chan was worried about 
upgrade paths for existing NOLA users, but Derek 
suspects the number of folks using NOLA that arent 
noguska's customers is so small - that backwards compatiability would be the most 
minimal of concerns - acclite had no schema changes from NOLA. ","2003-06-01","84"

think you can .debianize the latest dcl 
release? He was still planning, long-term, to convert DCL 
to a GNU Enterprise tool. 
Alternatively, he suggested Jeff might like to help 
me understand packaging enough to take 
it over so you arent wasting time maintaining something you are not 
directly involved with. Jeff said that if 
You can't upload it, so there's no point in 
you maintaining it. The ideal is that you should find a DD that cares 
about DCL. Derek said he was keen to become a Debian developer, 
and felt that maintaining DCL would be a good place to start. 
Jeff said that there were three steps to becoming a Debian developer - 
1) Get your GPG key signed by a DD - 2) Read 
the packaging and policy manuals. - 3) Find a sponsor. I can do #3 if 
you have #1 and #2 done.. He noted that 
The DCL packaging is annoying because it's a 
PHP app. What's the time frame for turning it into a real app 
based on the GNUe Tools?","2003-06-05","85"

any thoughts on how workflow is expected to be done in 
gnuenterprise? - Documents can 
TimeOut, be Rejected, Acknowledged, Auto Routed and so on. 
D Smith (dsmith) noted At the last 
place I worked he was trying to get 
time sheets automated - One big big 
issue is that the customer has to sign the sheet. We were thinking about 
ways to let the customer approve the sheet with a web based form.
But then there are security issues. Cutsomers looking at other customers 
projects, etc. With a piece of paper, you can wave it under his nose and 
he will sign it, but try an get them to go to a web page with tricky 
authentication. Charles said I'd like 
to get something started in GNUe so that my app is somewhat GNUe 
compatible. right now, I'm thinking the workflow engine would run in cron 
to automate/timeout/etc. One solution for this scenario 
could be the user receives an email with a url 
to the document he must ""sign"".. no authentication really needed 
as of course the url to that document would 
contain a ""random key"" to make it a little more secure. 
D Smith felt that The whole ""customer calls; 
trouble ticket generated; worker logs time; time approved; bill generated"" 
sequence ought to be fairly common. Any service industry..","2003-06-08","85"
"2307","1013","2","Derek Neighbors (derek) said he had spoken 
ad nausem about workflow previously - unlike others, he did not 
see it as just another part of appserver. 
Charles said he would like any work he was doing for himself to form the 
basis of (or, at least, be compatible with) whatever GNUe was doing on 
workflow - I guess I'll submit some proposals 
and get ya'lls input then. Derek said 
the key pieces i see as being necessary for 
success - 1. highly flexible (non programmer) way to define flow - 2. 
multiple transport mechanism - for part 1 i think of xml based rule 
flow, similar to the existing GNUe Forms Definitions (*.gfd) and 
GNUe Schema Definitions (*.gsd). for part 2 
i mean just like we are UI and Database agnostic, so too should we be 
'notification' agnostic - i.e. we should support web, email, jabber etc 
etc etc. i had diagrams and docs somewhere - but its been a while. 
He noted that GNUe Common already has rpc 
communication necessary for 'notifications' and 
has strong xml parsing engines.","2003-06-08","85"
"2308","1013","3","D Smith said he was thinking email, pdas, 
text messaging phones, and pagers as possible notification 
methods. Derek said he was thinking jabber 
would be interesting and have jabber embedded into GNU Enterprise framework 
(optionally) - so when you login to a GNU Enterprise application you have a 
little 'message' status bar D Smith noted there were 
sms and smtp trasports for jabber.  
Intresting. Derek said i suspect we 
will support all of those things - i.e. even within a company someone may 
like IM more than e-Mail - or prefer both. i know most 'approval' things i 
would want email - as IM or a page is reserved for 'important' 
things.","2003-06-08","85"

gnue-based ERP applications currently. Christian Selig (lupo) 
pointed out you forgot project papo - 
which is complete, but it is available in spanish only :( - it was written 
only with argentina in mind - but i heard something about papo people 
targeting whole south america in the long run. GNUe allowed you 
to develop data-driven applications quite 
rapidly. Any programming needed to be done in python, but 
Christian had found this quite easy to learn - 
it's more like javascript ""done right"". 
In any case, usually, 98% of a gnue based

it.","2003-06-09","85"

nola is a web-based free ERP from noguska.

Where an application was mainly about displaying

probably take longer to set the database up than to write the form definitions 
for GNUe Forms!","2003-06-09","85"
"2311","1015","1","Derek Neighbors (revDeke) admitted he had been dubious about Navigator at first

i think navigator is more the way to go. 
Christian Selig (lupo) said without a basic RBAC 
(Role Based Access Control - the ability to set which users can see/use which menu 
options) it is not usable for me. 
Jason Cater (jcater) conceeded that the original navigator 
was(is) clunky - navigator certainly isn't in its final form. Derek 
suggested maybe if you could dock it to the main form 
or have the forms open w/in navigator in an MDI type function - i think it will be 
HIGHLY usable - as of now its still usable. Jason said 
as with all things I see this as pluggable - I want an 
MDI-like interface that you describe (perhaps that will even become the default .. 
.I dunno) but the beauty of the .gpd -like definition was that people 
could write their own Navigator client or Navigator plug-in to present the contents 
of the GNUe Process Definition (*.gpd) file any way they wanted to.","2003-06-10","85"
"2312","1015","2","Christian asked what do you think about ""tabbed 
browsing"" for forms within navigator? Derek preferred trees, as he felt 
they were more intuitive for business people. Derek noted that both SAP and 
Peoplesoft had a menu system where end-users could build their own menu from the 
choices available - i.e. its almost like a 
'favorites'. He would try something similar in the GNUe Small 
Business application he was developing.","2003-06-10","85"

run patches against acclite - hen beg you guys to kill ARIAS cvs and use Acclite 
instead - /me garners his evil laughter. Later, he concluded it would 
not be as simple as that - not impossible just will 
be time consuming.  Chan Min Wai (dcmwai) said I've 
modified arias a lot .... really alot.... but noted that much of this 
was related to adding Languages translation 
Modification - ignoring these, I think that the 
differenr will be alot more smaller.","2003-06-11","85"
"2314","1016","2","Later, as the arias developers gathered on the channel, Derek said that 
the main issues for him with respect to co-operation were 
item 1 for me is are you willing to assign copyright 
to FSF on all future works? item 2 is are you willing to break all NOLA 
compatiablity and dependencies Josh Flechtner (jafgon) was fine on the 
first point, but more worried about the second - i 
am willing to break for a better solution but not just for the sake of 
breaking . Chan felt that breakage was not an issue, as long as there 
was an upgrade path. Derek said GNUe could help with this. He felt that 
incompatible changes were inevitable as their 
inventory, invoicing etc is WAY too print shop specific, reflecting 
the needs of Nogasaku, the original authors of NOLA, who wrote it as a GPL 
(free software) accounting package to sit alongside their proprietary print shop 
management software - however, the HR and Base 
Accounting (ledgers) we might be able to not gut too severely.","2003-06-11","85"
"2315","1016","3","Derek emphasised that GNUe had a very broad vision - it was intended 
eventually to be a free replacement for full ERP systems like SAP and Peoplesoft, 
rather than a Quickbooks or Peachtree replacement. Having said that, the 
GNUe Small Business sub-project had a less ambitious focus - 
i see gnue-sb as being a 2-tier small/medium 
enterprise base package - so you would get basic invoicing that works 80% of 
your needs - then a non programmer can modify forms/tables as necessary to meet 
the other 20% for the vertical industry you are in - 
we want something quickly - not something perfect - 
gnue proper (the official gnue ERP packages) are available for those wishing 
to over design a system - gnue-sb belongs to get something out to meet basic 
needs.","2003-06-11","85"
"2316","1016","4","Derek said he had gone off the idea of porting 
all arias changes back into acclite - assuming that the changes from 
NOLA to acclite had not taken too long, it would probably be easier to do this 
the other way around and apply the acclite changes to arias, 
then check into gnue-sb cvs or some fresh 
cvs. Jason Cater (jcater) said I think I spent 
a saturday night on the restructuring - both the directory cleanup 
and adding postgreSQL support - so it's probably not 
a big deal to do it again if need be. Josh said he would still keep 
the sourceforge page for arias up, and would answer any ""SOS"" support e-mails, 
but would focus his main effort on a joint gnue-sb/arias venture. Derek agreed - 
i suspect it will take a little time to get 
gnue-sb up and usable so ARIAS still is an option until that time (another 
reason not to cut it off).","2003-06-11","85"
"2317","1016","5","They discussed the practical steps involved 
in merging the code base - Derek said the priorities were to 
get dir structure over and

After that, the priorities, in whatever order people felt was urgent, were 
to fold in the existing Product and Contact support from GNUe Small Business, 
and adding the accounting functionality that Jason had 
requested.

apply to the arias code before the merge.","2003-06-11","85"

down to the table with the cursor keys and the table's node is still

assembly within products was a next step for Derek. However, Jason meant

"2330","1024","1","Derek Neighbors (derek) explained what a block was - 
A datasource provides a link to a table, 
but Forms needs more information than a simple reference to meaningfully 
interface with an end user. A block is the first step to making 
datasources suitable for such user interaction. At its most basic level, 
a block contains instructions on how Forms should interact with a datasource.
Any datasources that are to interact with a user must have a single 
corresponding block. Datasources that are only used internally and not for

the first part of this could be done with no code

www.fisterra.org for another GPL 
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) quoted 
a bit: ""Current release number is 1.4, this

of an system used to manage an automotive glass replacement and repair 
company. If you want to use it to manage your business you should check if 
the present features fit your requirements."" It was gnome-based, 
only 2 tier as of time of writing, and looks 
like a much less flexible system but has some good stuff in it :). 
Sacha noted that writing business applications 
needs lots of thinking. Business logic is 
difficult, different countries, taxes, systems, different accounting ... 
a lot is different and we the ideal of having a lot generic makes the 
task even more difficult. He noted that Fisterra was 
from a glass replacement company. They might 
have a clear requirement. We want point of sale with this, this, this 
available then you can go off and do it. But without clear requirements 
and the ideal to have everything generic its much harder.","2003-06-26","88"

1. In .gsd files, why name primary keys? Why not 
let the schema scripter do it? 2. What on earth are ""account""s under 
contact/schema? Organization/companies? 3. For the contact_<phone|addr|url> 
tables, are the contact_id + <phone|addr|url>_type_id fields unique? 
I assume it is unique, but am not 100% sure. (I.e., if you have ""Home 
Phone"" as a phone_type, can a contact have multiple ""Home Phone"" entries, 
without defining ""Home Phone #1"", ""Home Phone #2"", ... phone_types?). 
He didn't like contact management in gnue-sb, but promised to 
try my damnest to make it work for me. 
Jason was also trying to decide what to do about a 
financials package. He was trying to force himself to use 
nola/arias/acclite, and had converted their schema to .gsd files. 
Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) asked whether the arias guys had restructured it as 
they were going to and Jason had to admit - it's 
hosted on SourceForge and they've taken anon cvs down. So I can't work 
against their tree or see what they've done. Very frustrating.","2003-06-27","88"

with the semantic web. it's a concept that suggests the use of standardised 
markup formats for use in apps. more on the line of web services.
the idea is simply to use RDF/XML, which will 
help to rope together apps. He thought that GNUe Common, with its 
XML parser and RPC (remote procedure call) functionality, could be used to 
help with this.  He felt that if all GNUe 
Packages could use HTTP(REST'ically) as it's underlying app. protocol, 
their design could be significantly simplified. Andrew Mitchell 
(ajmitch) did not see how it would 
help. Vinay said that the current arch. 
seems to be inclined towards RPC/SOAP which 
SOAP complicates matters w/o any sufficient 
advantage. Andrew noted that GNUe applications were mainly written 
in two-tier (Forms/Reports talks to database) rather than three-tier 
(Forms/Reports talks to App Server talks to database), and he was not 
aware that even App Server was using SOAP yet. Any references to ""GEAS"",

The Tools are designer, forms, reports,

Business is accounting, inventory, etc that is designed as Keep It Simple 
Stupid (KISS) that is geared towards immediate solutions for people 
doing the work - non modular and lumped together quickly. GNUe Proper 
is the full blown ERP (SAP type equivalent) that will be highly modular 
and flexible and thoroughly designed. There were already some 
proposals for the proper GNUe packages, notably accounting, but these 
were more of a general accountants view 
of how things might look -  rather than an implementation path.","2003-07-04","89"

CVS code was ripe for release as 0.5.1. James said he was 
thinking about updating some common docs based upon some stuff I've done recently - 
but I can't see holding up a release for it as I bet Jason Cater (jcater)
and myself are the only ones currently baseing non-gnue 
apps on common - which is a shame as common rocks, as previously discussed in

"2371","1048","2","The 
next day, James chaged the IRC topic to announce 
New Pre-Releases available - 

http://www.gnuenterprise.org/downloads/prereleases.php.
Jeff Bailey (jbailey) said he would try to do some Debian packages (*.deb) for these 
pre-releases over the weekend.","2003-07-24","92"
"2372","1048","3","The 
next day, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) said he would be keen to have Debian 
packages for the pre-releases - /me is in a testing 
mood (but would rather test debs) - this is MOSTLY because i have GNUe training 
courses scheduled (yeah) - also der.hans (LuftHans) 
desperately needs debs, so he wont do the unthinkable 
and use php for an application instead of GNU Enterprise :) - so im down with testing 
debian packages.","2003-07-24","92"

next day, Derek gave a 
link to the first official GNU Enterprise 
training.","2003-07-24","92"
"2374","1049","1","Jeff Bailey (jbailey) asked is there a SQL based 
driver that uses flatfiles I can use for a testsuite? If not, 
I might have to write one then.
The 
next day, Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) noted that Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch)
had been looking at a flatfile driver (iirc) - 
so there might be some code there (or on his pc) - or at least he might be 
able to tell you where he scraped his knees :).","2003-07-25","92"
"2375","1049","2","Later, Andrew confirmed I started on something 
for CSV files, iirc - and the gadfly (a mini-DB) driver was working. 
However, he wondered is there any real reason for 
using flatfiles? Jeff said Yup: 
Testsuites. Andrew said well gadfly is 
probably minimal enough for that - since it doesn't require a db server. 
Plus it supports SQL without you having to write stuff to do so :) 
Jeff asked Does it act as a python database compliant 
with the DB-SIG API? Andrew said 
mostly. Jeff looked at gadfly, but 
was not convinced - I just want something that's 
python db-compliant, supports as much of SQL92 as is possible..","2003-07-25","92"
"2376","1050","1","Thierry Michel (thierry) asked is there 
some replication/synchronization toolkit in gnue ? Jeff Bailey 
(jbailey) thought that 
Integrator
might do that - Looks like it's only in CVS 
though. Thierry said he might be able to find a 
""profit project"" to finance this part 
Jeff said I think generally 
that's how most of GNUe is developped.  One of the core team gets a contract 
that needs it, so they code it. =)","2003-07-29","92"
"2377","1051","1","der.hans (LuftHans) needed some documentation for GNUe, and 
offered to write some of it himself - I have a 
consulting project to do and I keep threatening Derek that I'm gonna do 
it in PHP if I can't get going with GNUe soon - what I need is a basic, 
""how to get started with GNUe"" or something. Jason Cater 
(jcater) said he was actually working on docs 
earlier this week. der.hans explained mostly 
I'm needing to put a front end on a simple db right now, but in the end 
I think I have an opportunity to provide a full customer relations and 
inventory system for them, they'll probably stick with phpledger for 
medium term. Jason said I know it 
isn't much, but was the Form's Developer's Guide any help at all?
I started a Designer's User Guide earlier this week - but haven't 
gotten far with it at all - it is at 

http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/docs/designer/ - 
(much, much sparser than the developer's guide). 
der.hans said he had gone through it a couple of 
times, it's out of date, but did get me somewhat started. 
Jason asked whatever happened to derek's 
training sessions he was advertising in the next week or so?
der.hans said this was actually scheduled for the end of August, not 
July.","2003-07-29","92"
"2378","1052","1","Thierry Michel (thierry) asked whether object relationships 
(1:1, 1:n, n:m relationships) 
were handled in Application Server. Reinhard Müller 
(reinhard) said this was planned, but not yet implemented. 
However, i'm not sure if we will 
directly support n:m - what we have planned is that you can have a 
property of an object that ""points"" to another object. Like if 
invoice is an object - invoice.number might be an integer - 
invoice.amount might be another integer - and invoice.customer might 
be an object of type customer. Thierry explained that 
he was implementing a transparent mapping 
system based on CMP (Container-managed persistant) 
and a server based on XMLRPC protocol 
which serves business object and was 
trying to join my work to your work. 
He explained some of the details, and Reinhard felt
sounds somewhat similar to what 
appserver aims at - as basically 
appserver does not much more than providing persistant objects that are 
stored in database. Thierry offered to send Reinhard a tarball 
of his work so far. It was designed to run a database of 50,000 historical 
resources (newsreels, newspapers, etc) which would eventually be 
available via the internet. He noted that his approach to business 
objects was quite different to GNUe Application Server - 
registration is partially different.","2003-07-30","92"
"2379","1053","1","James Thompson (jamest) said gnue is 
really at this time all about the tools, 
although people like Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) are 
building apps with these tools. He explained 
gnue was to be two things - a set of tools 
to make building and maintaining gnue apps easy - a set of apps that 
implement an erp (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. 
However, it's taken years to get the tools to 
the state they are in today - realistically 
I think what is gonig to have to happen is the tools people still have 
to work on tools - and people like Vee2d2 have to tell us their needs -
as we're very needs based in tool development. He imagined 
that the erp side of gnue will grow rather 
haphasardly(sp?) - with each set of apps driving the needs of the tools.
I know that's how it's been working as several of us use the tools 
to implement in house systems -  and a lot of features of those tools 
wouldn't exist if we hadn't needed them in production.","2003-07-30","92"
"2380","1053","2","It was asked whether GNUe would use a relational database or an 
object database. James said well, we support 
both - theoretically - appserver is even an object server but 
users of GNUe as of time of writing used it with traditional relational 
databases. Jason Cater said that Common, the part of GNUe that the 
other GNUe tools used to talk to databases, was designed 
to (theoretically) support oodbms via 
the GNUe Application Server. He said we use pluggable 
handlers for everything - so for databases, you could use mysql, postgres, 
oracle, etc - same for communications - corba, xml-rpc, etc. James 
agreed - we try not to tie anything down to 1 
limited ""thing"" - where thing = ui widget set, communications protocol, 
etc.","2003-07-30","92"
"2381","1054","1","Mike Vincent (Vee2d2) said that If you had 
bills of materials and workorders.. perhaps you would just place a po for 
the raw materials, then create a workorder to have the materials turned 
into finished products, then since you're outsourcing the actual work.. 
you could create a po for the service rather than the product.. your 
work order would handle the conversion of raw material to finished 
product.. but IIRC, you dont do things like that, currently, in 
Arias. He explained that a bill of 
material (BOM) is like a recipe.. it lists raw materials needed to 
create something.. a workorder tells you how many somethings to make.. 
usually the flow is something like.. create a BOM, create a WO, kit 
the WO to take the raw materials described by the BOM from inventory 
and allocate them to the WO, complete the WO which then puts the finished 
product into inventory - there may need to be other steps in the process 
too.. like scrap or rework. James Thompson (jamest) asked 
you're doing inventory control system now 
right? Mike said not really.. the 
precursor to it, product mgmt - really using it as an excuse to learn 
enough to perhaps tackle something like the inventory system.
Chan Min Wai  (dcmwai) noted that A New 
version of Arias actually can do BOM  , and WO (in different name cause 
I don't know the standad name, I called it composit item control)
- this functionality was in the current CVS version. ","2003-07-30","92"
"2382","1054","2","Mike gave a specific example of the sort of business process he was 
talking about - say it's cds you're making.. 
you'll send a PO to a vendor to buy blank CDs.. then create a WO to have 
the blanks turned into Steel Buns Workout discs. You have a BOM that 
says to make one Steel Buns Workout disc you need 1 blank cd, 1 cd label, 
1 jewelcase, etc..  so you need 1000 cds, open a WO for 1000pcs, kit the 
WO, the system uses the kitting operation to take 1000 cds, jewelcases, 
and anything else listed on the BOM out of inventory (or maybe moved to 
a WIP [work in process]) location), you process the cds and when finished 
close the WO which adds 1000 Steel Buns Workout discs to your 
inventory. Chan asked So the WO is 
being Send within the PO on the Vendor is that the idea? And by using 
the WO, I can actuall generated a Deliver order to the Vendor as 
well.. Mike replied I've always thought 
of workorders as internal processes, but I guess you could do it that way. 
Since you're outsourcing the work, I would imagine you sending a po with 
drop ship instructions to the 1st vendor, create a WO, then when the 2nd 
vendor tells you they received the material you receive in the 1st PO and 
kit the WO.. you could have another PO for the cost of service the 2nd 
vendor's providing, but rather than 'Receive in' the product that vendor 
sends you you would close the WO.. James asked 
how far along is all of this? 
Mike said anything from 1 month to 1 year 
;0. Chan said that Arias will be the 
1st to test that :).","2003-07-30","92"

By contrast, Reinhard Müller (reinhard) had used the quiet season 
at work to make some time for gnue hacking

work.","2003-07-31","93"
"2384","1056","1","der.hans (LuftHans) asked can a displaymask be used 
to mask out dups for that field? James Thompson (jamest) said 
nope, masks are kind of a hack at the 
moment. der.hans asked what they would be able to do when 
finished. James said hard to say - 
he had done some 
initial
notes on them. der.hans suggested including validation in display 
masks - sort mask, mask to translate public IP addy 
to private IP addy... most is probably best done at the db, but weird 
people like me want to do it client-side :) In particular, 
in this particular case I'm using the same data for 
two different self-populating drop downs, but I need different masks on 
both, it seems that client-side manipulation would be better than hitting 
the db twice - then again, if it was a large dataset both would only be 
doing partial displays, so you couldn't do it at the client 
side... James rumages around a 
bit and came up with a datasource defintion that allowed you to 
build conditional filters on datasources.
Ne noted that the <condition> tag in datasources 
supports all kinds of stuff though - 
<null> <not> <and> <ge> etc etc - 
not sure if they're in the docs as of 
time of writing. However, the support for 'select count distinct' which 
he thought der.hans would need was not working.","2003-08-01","93"
"2385","1056","2","der.hans explained what I want is one dropdown 
that has date and another that has genre, but I don't want each event in 
the dropdowns, I just want unique dates and genres, then when you choose 
a date or genre the record set that's returned is all of the events of 
that type. James tried to fix the select count distinct bug, 
but no idea if it'll make distinct do what you 
want :) - but looking at the code all it does is add distinct to the std 
sql statement so it _should_ work. der.hans noted that 
according to postgresql docs distinct is not std sql, 
so will that cause a prob with other databases? James said it 
seems to be in the sql92 draft I have - 
it was the DISTINCT ON statement that was not compliant with the SQL92 
standard. der.hans reported a problem with James' fix - 
hmm, I'm now on record 5 of 2... 
James could not think of a quick fix for my 
quick fix - nothgin that is portable. He could come up with 
a solution that would work on PostgreSQL, but he did not think it 
would work on Oracle - and I can't use subselects 
as an out - as mysql doesn't do them. the 
only fix I can come up with is crap - which would be to perform the query 
and interate thru the cursor - counting.","2003-08-01","93"
"2386","1057","1","Derek Neighbors (dneighbo) was happy 
with the 0.5.0 release - despite its shortcomings it was fairly 
solid. However, he would rather use a buggy CVS version of 
GNUe than php - btw: i like php, just 
not for non website type of stuff i.e. real applications deserve 
more than a weblication :) Jason Cater (jcater) said 
I think cvs forms is no less stable than 
0.5.0. Designer on the other hand has probably doubled it's 
featureset. I don't think it's any less stable than 0.5.0 - but 
there's more opportunity to hit a bug now =).","2003-08-02","93"
"2387","1058","1","It was asked how to synchronise two data blocks in Forms, so that selecting 
a record in the first block would execute a query in the second block to 
show the related (master-detail) records. Dmitry Sorokin (dimas) explained 
if two blocks has one datasource the are sinchronized 
already. der.hans suggested looking in the Forms Developer Guide for 
information about master-detail datasources - alternatively 
tie in a trigger to explicitly update the other datasource, 
e.g. dtsRestaurants.createResultSet({'name': self.get()}). To switch 
between the blocks, there's a give focus mechanism as well 
as a take focus mechanism - don't know if they do what you want. Also, triggers 
can cause events for any datasource - events on the datasource are layout block 
independent. Alternatively, I'm presuming a trigger 
could cause two different queries, one for each datasource. When 
working with multiple blocks, any updates in either block would get applied 
correctly, but you're right that next/prev isn't working 
in both places, it just looked like it was... He overcame this by 
adding his own manual prev and next buttons in the form, 
then tied both to triggers that call prevRecord and nextRecord on both 
datasources. He also advised use prequery=""Y"" if 
you want to pre-populate something at form startup. And 
where clauses get done with conditions in the 
datasource definition - this was covered in the Forms documenation. 
if you need distinct/unique results you need to get the 
most recent forms engine from cvs, as discussed in 
.","2003-08-03","93"
"2388","1059","1","Problems were reported trying to use the pre-built Windows version of GNUe with Oracle.
Jason Cater (jcater) said I've hit that problem as well - 
and don't have an elegant solution. We use oracle here too. He believed that the 
cxOracle 
driver to allow python applications like GNUe to talk to Oracle databases 
had win32 binaries now. However, it was not 
really possible to use these with the pre-built Windows version of GNUe 
as our installer encapsulates its own python 
environment - it was not a standard Win32 python installation. 
The other alternative was to install GNUe from source. On GNU/Linux, this was 
as easy as pre-built, but on Microsoft Windows platforms it was 
a bigger headache, although it gave much 
more flexibility. He explained that, for 
the pre-built Windows version, what our installer does
is basically takes a snapshot of someone's GNUe + Python + Needed Libraries 
installation and creates a frozen-in-time image that others can install on their 
system. Advantage of this approach is our program behaves like any other windows 
program i.e., single executable, single installation, etc (no searching for 
prerequisites). The downside is you can only use the libraries that this particular 
person has installed. And, obviously, we can't have our windows packager install 
the oracle clients as that'd be a not-so-small license violation, as 
the Oracle SQL*Net client software was definantly not freely redistributable! 
another option would be to connect to the Oracle backend 
via ODBC, as ODBC support was included in the pre-built Windows version, 
although I'm personally not a big fan of ODBC. 
At his work place, he had side-stepped the issue by installing X clients 
on the Windows 98 machines so that they could run GNUe on a remote GNU/Linux 
server instead. He noted that introspection does not 
work on ODBC, so GNUe Designer would not be able to query the database 
to find out what tables and fields the database had - ODBC was therefore only 
really suitable for end-users rather than people trying to develop forms.","2003-08-04","93"
"2389","1059","2","He hinted that we've actually come up with a workaround 
for the ODBC+introspection stuff - but haven't had a chance to implement. 
This involved writing add-ons to the standard ODBC support in GNUe to provide 
the commands specific to each database to get introspection information for a variety 
of supported databases. Then, when using the ODBC driver, you could specify 
not only what database driver to use (i.e. 
ODBC) but also what database ""personality"" to use
when doing introspection. This concept of database ""personality"" could also be 
used with the database-specific (non-ODBC) drivers, where the commands for 
introspection had changed from version to version, 
which he understood was the case with IBM's DB2 database, as previously 
discussed in

Derek Neighbors (derek) said a

interface was supported - alternatively, if you meant 
non gui as no interaction
then you could make python scripts 
that use common and have them be unattended. He 
explained curses was poorly maintained 
for a long time - then it got a lot of attention just before 0.5.0

release applications he wrote under the GPL, but his 
company would need to be convinced of the benefits of 
this. Reinhard saud the 
main benefit is getting back imporvements from the 
community - this 
is for example what i experienced with you last week with 
your fixes to appserver :) Also, opening up the 
source reduced the reliance on key individuals - this was 
especially significant for smaller software houses.","2003-08-18","95"
"2404","1068","4","Also, don't forget
you don't have to open the source code to the world - 
you just have to open it to your customer - 
and let him open it to whomever he likes. Most customers 
will probably keep it to themselves anyway. 
The gpl doesn't say you 
have to give your code to anyone - you can keep it all for 
yourself if you like - but _when_ you give it away, you have 
to 1. give the source code, too 2. let the receiver give it 
to any 3rd persons he wants under the same conditions. 
So it might be totally normal to write code under gpl
- and give it only to a single customer. There 
was no requirement under GPL to make the source available to 
all and sundry, for example by putting it on an anonymous 
CVS service like savannah. der.hans (LuftHans) noted 
also, technically you don't have to give 
the source code to your customers, you just have to make it 
available to them. Reinhard agreed -

myself instead of the source code when installing 
Debian GNU/Linux for clients.","2003-08-18","95"

click on a tab in a multi-page form, it loses the focus - and selection with up/down 
keys from a dropdown doesn't work yet - just with Shift+up/down - but it's not intuitive, 
imho. Johannes said that, to check this, he'd created a sample application 
just using the base wx driver, and i could use the 
up/down keys without shift-key to navigate within the popup. Reinhard Müller 
(reinhard) wondered if it's the form catching the 
keypress before the UI gets it but this was not the case - Johannes 
just added a debug-print to the __keypress signal 
handler and found that it does not get 
anything. In any case, this works fine for 
gtk and osx.","2006-03-07","107"
"2445","1093","2","Jason Cater (jcater) said that these sorts of issues were 
the main reason we split away from using wx into all the

abstract the GNUe Forms code away from specific user interfaces had been a quick 
way of being able to support many different user interfaces and operating systems 
all at once (as described in 
), 
but having a ""native"" driver for each user interface library was the better 
long-term option in terms of being able to fully support different UI drivers.

(wx) hell - we hope you like it here.","2006-03-07","107"
"2446","1093","3","Johannes reported back that i've found out why 
up/down does not work for dropdowns on wx.MSW - it is the menu-item for ""next 
record"" and ""previous record"" which are bound to up and down keys - 
on wx.MSW the menu seems to have a higher priority than the current control - 
so the keypress is eaten by the menu !! He developed a work-around for 
this by changing the ""key_PrevRecord"" and 
""key_NextRecord"" in gnue.conf (as an intermediate solution). 
But he would send an e-mail to the wx developers to see if this could be fixed 
properly within wx, however.","2006-03-07","107"
"2447","1093","4","Reinhard was reminded that I have never liked 
the cursor keys being bound to record navigation - I feel it's plain wrong to 
have the cursor keys bound to a menu item as a hotkey. Johannes noted 
that it's very problematic in this case. 
Reinhard noted that there are quite a lot of 
controls that use cursor keys natively - multi line edits, dropdowns, radio 
buttons (that we don't have anyway) - and we will either break that native behavoiur 
(like it is now with the dropdowns) - or it will be impossible to go next/prev 
record when the focus is on such a control, because the control will eat the 
keypress. James said this had been done in GNUe Forms originally to 
emulate Oracle Forms, but asked what would you 
replace those keys with? Reinhard was not 
sure but suggested setting aside four function keys 
matching first, prev, next, last might be an option, 
but that would mean to redefine other f-keys, too - alt cursor keys might be 
another option. James wasn't keen on using the function keys, but 
i could live with the alt-curs-up|down setup i 
imagine as it would require little new learning for the people here - 
and alt left right could work same as shift-tab/tab i imagine. 
However, Reinhard believed that alt cursor keys 
are not available on curses, the text-only user interface which 
GNUe needed to support, along with the graphical user interfaces (as 
previously discussed in 
) 
- and in any case, alt left right might be useful 
to change tabs. Johannes noted that this currently used 
ctrl-page-up/down.","2006-03-07","107"
"2448","1093","5","James noted that some of the current key mappings were not ideal - 
F12 == new record - F11 = rollback - two functions 
that shouldn't be anywhere near each other on the keyboard. In any 
case, Johannes pointed out that F11 was used 
by the window-manager on os x and so was unusable on Apple Macs. 
Other potentially usuable function keys were also already mapped in different 
operating systems. James wondered if we'll need 
environment specific mappings. Nobody was that keen on this, especially 
since they could see themselves using GNUe on different operating systems 
at the same time, but felt that it might be unavoidable - James just did not 
see us finding one magic keybinding set that works 
everywhere.","2006-03-07","107"

days later, Tamás asked that keypresses should be configurable - 
i have more than 100 old customers 
using my old foxpro based app from 1992 -  using up/down arrows 
to change next/prev record - they will kill me, if i ever chage 
it to shift/ctrl/alt +up/down - we (kilo and me) started to 
rewrite it in gnue - fortunately we have no deadlines in 
stone. At first, Johannes did not think he could 
do very much about that, as i don't 
get that event at all (at control-level) Reinhard suggested 
maybe it would be an idea to *not* 
assign cursor up/down as a menu hotkey as well. Johannes 
said that would help, and if we 
skipp up/down in the keymappers getEventKeyStroke .. it still 
works (as the keymapper can still associate the event) - 
but it is not bound in the menu. Later, he reported 
that he had got it working 
so that users could still use the up/down keys for next/previous 
record generally, but that whilst in a dropdown these keys would 
navigate between drop-down entries instead.","2006-03-07","107"

let us capture all events on an object consistently enough - so it makes the 
designer experience ""lacking"" - so I'm experimenting with drawing the 
controls within the GNUe Designer code itseld rather than leaving this 
to the wx libraries. Reinhard wondered if maybe 
wx2.6 has become better on that. Jason replied not 
really - actually stuff that I could get away with in 2.4 - won't work in 2.6 - 
/me found out the hard way this weekend :).","2006-03-07","107"
"2455","1094","3","He confirmed that I'm not changing too much how 
designer works with forms - as I know you'll be changing some stuff - I'm working 
more on the designer code base itself - as designer was designed to be able to edit 
any GObject-based structure (any XML definition used for a GNUe object - 
whether it be a form definition, report definition, trigger or whatever) 
and I have a lot of GObject-based stuff in-house.","2006-03-07","107"
"2456","1095","1","Peter Sullivan (psu) asked what's the current 
status of the project? His perception was: a) 
Two tier tools - pretty much mature, in that jcater and jamest have all the features 
they want - b) App Server - probably where 2-tier tools were when I was last here, 
i.e. useful 0.somethings but still needs work - c) Packages - still really waiting 
for anyone to take an interest. Not really a focus for any of the existing 
developers. James Thompson said that the two-tier tools (GNUe Forms, 
GNUe Reports, etc.) did not have all the features
he wanted, but i've been unable to find time to GNUe 
seriously in years. Jason Cater felt that appserver 
is probably more stable than the 2-tier at this point - but that's for reinhard to 
say. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that 
appserver is more or less only missing 2 key 
features before 1.0: authentication/access control and transaction/locking 
support.","2006-03-09","107"
"2457","1095","2","He added that the GNUe packages would actually 
be a focus for me, but I have no time. gnue-luca is started but stalled. 
This was a series of ERP packages for GNU Enterprise, 
targeted at small and medium companies.  Its major aim is to provide a comfortable and 
easily usable solution for the most common tasks in such companies, while still 
remaining flexible enough that it can be extended to fulfill more specialized
jobs. He added `Luca' is an acronym for 
'Lightweight Utility for Company Accounting'. However, 
some people believe that the name was really chosen in memory of 
Luca Pacioli,
an Italian mathematician (1445-1517) who is credited with the first publication
of the `Venetian method' of keeping accounts, now known as double-entry
bookkeeping. Peter remembered Double-entry 
bookkeeping is one of those things that was sort of discovered rather than invented - 
in that the Venetian merchants noted that whenever they sold something - they had to 
record the reduction of stock in the stock book - and the debt incurred by the 
merchant who bought it in their accounts receivable book - Soon they started 
cross-refering the two entries - and voila - double entry bookkeeping. 
The conversation drifted off onto Enron jokes.","2006-03-09","107"

Windows if it was not started from within the 
c:\program files\gnue\bin directory - was it necessary to 
set an environment variable to avoid this? James Thompson 
(jamest) didn't think that was 
necessary. He upgraded to the latest version, and 
couldn't reproduce the error - it
loaded forms, let me login, then tracebacked. He 
suggested asking Bajusz Tamás (btami), who 
maintains the windows port.","2006-03-10","107"

not installed, this exception generated. He was intending 
to enhance all of the GNUe executables for Windows

a real test schema for gnue?, clarifying 
i mean db structures. Reinhard 
Müller (reinhard) said I always use 
zipcode and the appserver sample. James said he had a very 
simple two-table database he often used, but this was not much of 
a test - i was hoping maybe we had 
something like MS's 
northwind 
db setup - it's a complete schema for a business as a sample.","2006-03-11","107"

consolidate our samples and test forms - most of them are not maintained

time to do some cleanup of samples - so I 
can start some unit tests. Reinhard suggested building a sample 
database in the gnue-samples dir - 
as it will be gpd, gfd, grd and everything. They discussed some 
of the details. Reinhard would prefer a 
*single* well-maintained sample, or at any rate 
one 2-tier and one appserver - 
where they could even be the same in 
principle - just ported to appserver - and the sample would not only 
contain the schema but also some data - that would really be great to 
have.","2006-03-11","107"

Definition (.gsd) file as the sample or can

fulllfill all dependecies.","2006-03-11","107"

asked is there a proper way to deal with 
postal codes internationally, as he was 
starting with the zipcode sample - 
and so I have zipcode and state - which are kinda americanized

postal code in british english - and for most of europe, the order is ""zip 
city"" - and as most countries in europe are a little bit smaller than 
the US, there is no need for a state.","2006-03-11","107"
"2464","1097","5","Later, James confirmed i'm creating a 
testkit starting w/ an invoice - it's not suited for real world invoicing

was uncovering some bugs in the code. He discussed the directory structure
to store this in with Reinhard. He also said i'm 
working from the assumption that unit tests are going to expect - a fresh 
gnue db for each run. Reinhard confirmed 
that's what we have always done with our tests 
in appserver. James wished gnue-schema 
could deal with changes in the structure better - or an option to overwrite 
the existing db structures if passed a flag but Reinhard made the 
point that so far, we deliberately didn't make 
gnue-schema delete anything that is already there - just to not have the 
risk of accidentally deleting things, which James agreed with. 
Reinhard noted that it should work with adding 
columns - changing the type of an existing column is probably not possible 
for most databases that GNUe had drivers for, 
except with dropping and creating it again - 
which will lose all data.","2006-03-11","107"

next day, Bajusz Tamás (btami) asked whether James had

use in unit tests, samples, etc.","2006-03-11","107"

next day, James asked whether 
the sample gsd files I put into gnue-samples

was in a different file.","2006-03-11","107"

types - date, time, datetime, boolean, 
test, number with and without fractions - also an example of
a fishhook where a table references 
itself for a foreign key. For instance, a part/item record could have a 
field defining a possible replacement/substitute part (which would be 
another item in the same table), or an employee record could have a field 
defining their boss (who would be another employee in the same table).","2006-03-11","107"

i think we're talking about revamping all the 
various samples in gnue - as so many are broken - and make a single, consistant 
sample system - nothing complex - that's what I started in gnue-samples.
Jason had been using sample data sets with about 300 records, but the consensus 
was that a smaller data set was needed for the GNUe samples - Reinhard felt 
that 300 records is too little anyway to do 
performance tests - and OTOH it's too much as that you could easily predict 
what should come out of a specific operation. Jason agreed, saying 
that his sample set was mainly used for reporting 
tests - which explains the size. Reinhard noted 
in the appserver sample I think we had 5 
records - I think something between 5 and 10 might be enough.
Jason felt that this was about right for sample standing data tables, but 
that sample fact data tables needed to be larger for 
reporting or other aggregate-type things.","2006-03-11","107"

so where I'd put them in common. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) suggested 
that a chain of OR statements in python would do exactly the same. Johannes

on a solution to. He suggested that we just 
fetch the whole resultset for interbase especially since 
a fetch up to the end of the result set happens quite 
frequently anyway, I think this should be acceptable. Bajusz Tamás 
(btami) pointed to a 
forum
posting outlining another possible approach, but Reinhard felt that his 
suggestion was better, as it could also apply to a 
similar problem in sqlite3. This was not an issue with some other relational 
data base management systmes - postgres just lets the 
cursor survive a commit. He added we can always 
remove it again later and do the ""proper"" fix, if we see that we have performance 
problems with the fetchall - but as I said at latest when you click on the save 
button, the whole resultset will be fetched into memory anyway. Johannes

fine for sqlite3 now.","2006-03-14","108"

to be a bit of a cop-out, it highlights some of the problems that GNUe inevitably

way to deal with parameters that works for every case... I don't 
know if there is any chance to pass the parameters to the form before 
it is activated. James asked how 
are parameters handled now? Reinhard 
they are passed to activateForm so they 
are available from activation - for the __main__ form, the command

doesn't butcher my legacy forms. This meant using 
gtk1 - and people hate it - but it's all i

use uidrivers at all - it'd have a few 
abstrations for menus, toolbars, and such that would link to native widget 
sets - then it'd have a way to offer up workspace windows to apps - those 
would be native panel type windows inside navigator - where forms could 
treat that as a standard panel and draw the ui on it with ui drivers.

normally - but it becomes part of the ""navigator"" desktop (for lack of 
a better word). James said his idea was similar 
with the addition of plug ins - so the 
navigator tree would be a plug in - that would add a nav panel that

He was currently calling it 'GNUe Application Platform,' (GAP) but 
this was not important. It would have a foundation (the primary 
application), a service registry (to manage components - this 
would always be loaded), and then utilities for things like 
logging support, configuration processing, debug support, 
profiler, command line processor and datasources.","2006-03-27","109"

i could also see the base UI framwork

they need.","2006-03-27","109"

where the benefits are. James explained that it would 
allow more changes to be loaded as a config file at runtime, 
rather than change the underlying application. Jason realised 
that addComponent('gap.utility.datasources')
may or may not coincide with a gap.utility.datasources? - 
it could be any class registering itself as providing that 
""service"". James confirmed this - 
the other components of forms wouldn't 
be looking for say gDebug specifically - they'd say ""give me whatever 
provides gap.application.debug"" - and use that if it's 
loaded This would mean you'd no 
longer have hard coded dependency between the various sections of 
gnue. This was pretty similar to what the Zope 3 interfaces 
were doing - he gave some examples.","2006-03-27","109"
"2491","1111","6","James noted so where we'd end up 
is - a system made of components with a well defined API via an 
interface - loaded components would register with some type of 
manager - components could ask for the component that provided the 
""Foo Service"" then use that service without hard coded links between 
components. Reinhard was still 
trying to understand how we would use this in gnue-forms - I can't 
imagine a situation where I would want to, say, replace the GDebug 
system with something different for instance. But 
I could really imagine something like 
this useful for adding new GF* elements to forms - like we have no 
tree view, so I can write my own and plug it in - 
but I think that could be done with 
python's abilities to dynamically load modules.","2006-03-27","109"

designer, appserver, navigator all use this system - so instead of 
saying ""what can I do in forms"" - we pull back and say, what 
can I do in the app. Here I have lots of GClientApp stuff - lots - 
but each business application written using the GNUe Tools 
would only need to load the options it needed, not the whole of 
each tool. If an application needed some functionality that 
wasn't in any of the existing tools, the GNUe Application Platform 
would provide a standard way of plugging it in. He gave some 
possible examples of this.","2006-03-27","109"

you anyway - but I'm slightly worried about the overhead this adds to 
gnue in terms of complexity and 
number of abstraction levels - which probably means higher learning 
curve for people wanting to hack gnue. James felt the 
opposite, as did Jason - by having a single, unifying, interface

to reflect the amount of space available when a form was resized - would 
mean taking out the char based placement. 
Reinhard said that he thought must leave that 
char based placement in for compatibility.","2006-03-28","110"
"2495","1112","2","James asked how controls would be 'anchored' to the form. 
Reinhard replied I think we will need some 
way to define which control will be resized to what extent - but there 
will be useful defaults for most cases - like all text entries can resize 
horizontally - multi line entries can resize vertically, single line entries 
can't, etc. James explained how he would anticipate it working - 
typically a widget or panel can anchor at 1 or 
2 side - which top and left would mean that the placement of that panel or 
widget would link to closest one to the top and closest to the left. 
If a widget was allowed to resize, then if I'm 
anchored to the top and left and I'm set to fill vertically then i'll grow 
downward till i hit the next widget or a container - so I could anchor the 
top and left of a widget to the panel itself - anchor another on left to 
the panel and top to the previous widet - then anchor another on left to 
the panel and on bottom to the panel - then the middle widget would fill 
the space between. He felt that in real 
life it works pretty well although doing 
something like that in forms would require some type of region tag that you 
could nest.","2006-03-28","110"
"2496","1112","3","The 
next day, Jason Cater (jcater) was nervous 
going away from the pluggable layout system we had moved to to 
using a single, hardcoded layout manager like 
this. Jan Ischebeck (siesel) agreed - I 
hope to still be able to use the character based layout. Reinhard 
explained actually I would be aiming at making 
different layout systems work as opposed to the single, hardcoded x/y 
positioning we have now.","2006-03-28","110"
"2497","1112","4","James noted that forms lets you plug in 
layout managers already - just no other 
layout managers have been written. Jason added that 
the intention was to have the layout plugin system 
in common instead of forms, too so that the other GNUe tools, not 
just GNUe Forms, could use it.","2006-03-28","110"
"2498","1112","5","Reinhard asked how would you implement x/y 
positioning without accessing the x/y parameters? James said that
positioning would be the job of the layout mgr 
entirely - if the user interface had built-in layout management 
features (which some did), these would be used, but if not, the layout 
management routines would handle this. Reinhard asked whether this would 
mean having and maintaining two complete sets 
of uidrivers? one for x/y based and one for layout management?","2006-03-28","110"
"2499","1112","6","Reinhard had not yet understood why anybody 
should want char based positioning in a form for other reasons than to keep 
compatibility with old forms - especially as I figure char based positioning 
is a hell to implement in html or similar frontends. Bajusz Tamás 
(btami) gave the example of wanting forms 
that exactly matching reports providing  by law - for example, 
for tax purposes.","2006-03-28","110"
"2500","1112","7","James emphasised that i don't see layout 
management as something the UI objects should take part in - i think the 
entry objects should provide hints to the layout manager about what they 
want - but not participate in the layout. They could express a 
preference like now ""i want to sit in 
the 3rd chair in isle 4"" or relative to other objects but 
the layout manager would process these hints and 
stick them wherever it feels like honoring the hints - 
if it wants to do x/y positioning that would 
be ok - but it it wants to use UI specific containers then it 
could. Discussion continued.","2006-03-28","110"
"2501","1113","1","Further to 
, 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that his view of GNUe Application Platform (GAP) 
was that it was a way of providing clients a cleaner 
way to get at the GNUe Common Library and 
each other. He noted that right now, all 
client apps are based on GClientApp, which takes 
care of initializing some services - gap is 
providing a way for all components of a tool to get at that ""service"" 
cleanly. For example, the current way of sharing connections was 
messy, and caused problems when refactoring code. And this was just connections - 
there were other componants that tools might want to share. GAP, by contrast, 
would allow any component of any tool to declare 
what components of other tools it needs - without creating an __init__ 
nightmare.","2006-03-28","110"
"2502","1113","2","James Thompson (jamest) added that it also 
enables an application to only load the components it needs - like in my 
case I have lots of based on the core GNUe client application 
code - however not all need the command line 
parsing, or configuration file support - so in those cases I wouldn't make 
a request for that service and it wouldn't load. He hoped that 
eventually, if it proves out, all the other 
gnue apps could use gap as their base - and with the simple high level UI 
common setup you could say ""I love designer, I do.  I want to use it to edit 
all my python apps"" - you could take designer's startup config file (that 
says which components to load) and remove the gui layout parts, leaving 
only it's trigger editor component to make it an editor for generic 
python code, not just GNUe triggers.","2006-03-28","110"
"2503","1114","1","It was asked how GNUe dealt with different time zones - in a three-tier 
set up (forms talks to Application Server talks to back-end database), 
the users of a forms could be in different time zones to each other, and 
different to the time zone of the Application Server and/or the database 
server. This could create problems sorting entries by date/time order. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted that, as of time of writing, 
there is no timezone handling currently - 
so appserver just takes time values like you give it - so if you use 
gnue_createdate etc it's all in the timezone appserver is running 
in. Johannes Vetter (johannesV) noted that 
well, actuall python's datetime.datetime 
has no 'native' timezone either - instead one would have to implement 
timezone-support if needed. Reinhard noted that 
converting times values to UTC before 
storing in the db might not be what most users would expect - still 
somebody searching in the db directly via sql might be surprised to 
find ""wrong"" values.","2006-03-30","110"
"2504","1114","2","Reinhard noted that the specification for XML-PRC (the XML 
specification for Remote Procedure Calls, which GNUe Application 
Server was intended to be compatible with) said that 
It should be specified by the server 
in its documentation what assumptions it makes about 
timezones. so it looks like you can't pass a timezone there by 
definition - and that we can define, for example, that all dates 
must be the timezone which appserver runs in.","2006-03-30","110"
"2505","1114","3","Reinhard agreed 100% that timezone 
handling is a missing feature in appserver - which would have to be 
implemented by either documenting something, or some changes in 
appserver itself, or (most probably) both. I think it would make 
most sense to make the client responsible to send only UTC time 
values to the server - but then appserver would have to convert 
all automatically set times to UTC, too - like gnue_createdate etc
- which currently is in appserver's local time zone - and I figure 
there's a whole bunch of other problems we might run into if we 
look closer, for example the fact that the date part of a 
datetime value can change when you convert timezones.","2006-03-30","110"
"2506","1114","4","Reinhard concluded I think this 
really needs more thinking - also regarding different backends and 
how *they* are able to handle timezones. Later on, he 
documented 
the issue as a wishlist item for 
appserver.","2006-03-30","110"
"2507","1115","1","Johannes Vetter (johannesV) asked what block-level 
focus-triggers were for in Forms. James Thompson (jamest) replied 
that they provide a higher level trigger than per 
entry level - so you could define a trigger that validates that fields x,y,z match 
a specific combo of values - and block navigation if they did not. In 
other words, they fire on any focus change in that 
block, not just on movement into or out of the block. This meant that, 
if you moved from one entry field to another in the same block, you would fire 
four triggers all at once - the focus-out trigger for the field and block and 
the focus-out trigger for the field and the block. Even if you were moving 
from one field within the block to another field still within the block. This 
was intended to match a similar feature in a proprietary database forms 
software package.","2006-04-03","110"
"2508","1116","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that the version of 
GNUe running as a Debian package read the connections.conf 
file (which told GNUe which databases to connect to, and how) from 
/etc/gnue/connections.conf.
Andrew Mitchell (ajmitch) confirmed this, saying that the 
version of this file in /usr/local/gnue/etc was used when set 
up from source code since /usr/local 
should never ever be seen in a package in order to comply 
with Debian packaging guidelines. He would do 
Debian packages for the new releases soon - 
I just need to get around to it

"2509","1117","1","Bajusz Tamás (btami) noted that the 
clear form button now gives an empty resultset, but most users want 
to clear the form (the last record you edited) - and dont want to 
lose the last queried resultset. Johannes Vetter (johannesV) 
commented that it is not ""clear 
form"" but ""rollback"", isn't it ? Tamás said 
my users think it's an undo like button - 
but they are disappointed after clicking it. Reinhard Müller 
agreed - actually I can't see any 
advantage of ""clear"" against ""undo"", 
but undo might be tricky with appserver
- for 2-tier, undo can simply reset all records to original 
state He noted that ""undo"" would also have to start 
a new transaction - so also changes 
from other users would/should become visible then as 
we would have to requery anyway.  
This would involve storing the last 
query and simply redoing it.","2006-04-05","111"
"2510","1117","2","Later, Jason Cater (jcater) said he wasn't sure what the issue 
was - was it just the wording of that buttun isn't 
clear (no pun intended?) He would agree 
""Clear"" maybe isn't the best word to describe it - 
to me ""Revert to Database"" or ""Reset"" or something 
might be clearer. Reinhard replied that 
the basic point was that a function to 
undo all changes since the last save (but ""stay"" in the current 
resultset) would be more useful than replacing the current result set 
with an empty one. James Thompson saw this 
as 2 separate functions - i wouldn't mind 
seeing an undo - and clear used to be called rollback but users didn't 
grok the meaning. I'm not sure how other places do it but here users 
will query something to edit it then clear, then 
enter a new record. 
Reinhard didn't understand this behaviour - 
why do they clear instead of insert? 
James said i think it's mental, they want 
a clean slate to work with - they also know with a blank screen they 
aren't accidentally changing a previously loaded record. Reinhard 
said that, in that case, he could see use 
for both undo and clear. James noted that 
fwiw: users are completely oblivious to 
the MOD, INS, OK status bar - i gave up trying to get them to use 
it.","2006-04-05","111"
"2511","1117","3","Reinhard asked whether you would 
still make ""clear"" destroy all unsaved changes? or would 
we clearly separate the function of destroying unsaved changes and 
clearing the resultset? James felt that 
 in my mind clear is nothing but a 
rollback - and the current behaviour of not prompting for ""save 
unsaved changes"" is bad. Reinhard agreed.","2006-04-05","111"
"2512","1118","1","James Thompson was trying to 
regrok the input mask system. This, as of time of writing,
allowed you to have input masks that were a mix of alpha, number 
and date elements, but not a mix of just number and date elements - 
he had removed this restriction as I thought it 
somewhat arbitrary Reinhard Müller (reinhard) felt that 
combining something else with dates 
sounds odd to me anyway. James agreed - just about 
the only thing I could think of where 
I'd posibly use that is a made up code with a date-stamp
element like YY-MMDD###### or some such 
thing. Reinhard felt that this could still cause problems 
if the numeric part was right-padded with spaces, which would be 
the normal behaviour for numbers.","2006-04-06","111"
"2513","1118","2","Reinhard added that the question 
is what kind of value you want to get from the mask, 
actually.James said right now 
it's always a string. Reinhard felt that was inefficient, as
it implied doing two type conversion when 
we get datetime from the 
database, and we need to push datetime into the database. 
James said that there would need to be at least two different 
input masks anyway - one for display, and one for editing, but 
this would mean Forms would need to 
store two values per field then?. Reinhard said that this 
was 'sort-of' the case already - the 
displayhelpers have a ""value"" and a ""work"" 
variable.","2006-04-06","111"
"2514","1118","3","James suggested in the case of 
numbers - we'd always return a Decimal instance or a Decimal and/or 
int. Reinhard wasn't sure whether all of the backend 
databases that GNUe worked with supported decimals.","2006-04-06","111"
"2515","1118","4","Later, Jason Cater (jcater) noted that input 
masks were supposed to return the appropriate data type - it does 
separate out 3 types of masks - numeric, date/times, and general 
strings - each set having its own set of mask elements - so MMDD isn't 
gonna work in numeric without changing the code. He had 
actually put most of the effort into the numeric input masks to start 
with, so it was possible that the date input masks were not as fully 
featured. He had started with numeric as it 
in my mind is by far the hardest to get right - with comma-addition, 
fixed or floating decimal support, and support for optional 
characters such as currency signs.","2006-04-06","111"
"2516","1119","1","Johannes Vetter asked what was the 
intention behind setting the initial focus to the first focusable 
entry of the *first* block defined in a gfd ? instead of using the 
first focusable entry of the *first* <page> defined ?
It was also noted that the way the focus moves in the 
order the fields appear in the block was also 
annoying. Johannes noted you'd 
have to define a focusorder to avoid it, right ? Reinhard 
Müller (reinhard) felt that the order 
of the entries appearing in the GNUe Forms Definition file 
(gfd) would make up a good default focus 
order - in any case a better focus order than the fields in the 
block. This was agreed - if people wanted to change 
the default order, they could always set the focusOrder on 
each widget. Reinhard still could not 
understand the whole concept behind 
block based navigation - I mean - when we separate logic and ui
it makes no sense to bind focus navigation to the logic instead of 
to the ui.","2006-04-07","111"
"2517","1119","2","Later, James Thompson (jamest) said this might cause him 
problems - i'll have to do tests but I 
imagine the focus order change will break every form I have - not 
that I'm really against the change though, i haven't thought it thru 
yet :) The reason for having block-based naviagtion was 
it allowed you to hold navigation to a 
specific set of your data - off the top of my head invoice entry 
might be a good example - the master invoice block at the top of 
the page would be for contact info, totals, etc - the detail block 
of line items would be at the bottom. You could then 
use blocks for efficient navigation to allow both selection 
from a drop-down list and direct entry of new items. He added 
i guess if form had true container 
widgets like an expanded <box> then those could replicate 
and eventually replace the block functionality - but we'd also have 
to think about the 1:N field:entry relationship - as now a focus 
trigger on a block would fire for each entry linked to that 
field. Jason Cater (jcater) added a 
group of multi-row entries linked together by a block is much more 
than just a ""layout"" issue - they have fundamentally 
different logic. I'm not opposed to moving to a layout-based 
""container"" for that - but just keep in mind, you're 
shifting from one set of problems to another set - as then you need 
to move logic concepts into the layout. Reinhard could 
see the logic of the block-based focus 
navigation when it comes to master/detail - it seems I need to think 
more about it.","2006-04-07","111"
"2518","1120","1","Jan Ischebeck (siesel) asked how 
is designer improving? Jason Cater (jcater) said 
it requires wx2.6 now - so the first 
change was getting it stable on 2.6. Then I stopped using GNUe 
Form's ui drivers to draw widgets in real-time on the layout 
canvas - I now draw my own objects on my own canvas object - 
this gave me a tremendous amount of control over the canvas - 
so things ""just work"" on it now - like rubberband 
boxes, etc. I also reworked the property editor - which as it 
turns out - was solely responsible for the 2+ second delay
between clicking on a widget, and having designer actually 
select that widget. Actually, that will be the extent of the 
changes before I declare designer ""stable"" again - 
but there's a lot of under the hood cleaning (comments, better 
variable naming, etc).","2006-04-12","112"
"2519","1120","2","Jan said that he was thinking how 
to enable designer to create appserver designs, alongside 
its current role as a designer for Forms and Reports. Jason 
said he definantly wanted to tackle that

work yet - it needed to be a tool for end users who were 
not programmers but who understood the business process they 
were trying to model.","2006-04-12","112"

"2521","1121","1","Referring back to 
, 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted the consensus that 
it would be logical if after a commit the 
complete result set would be queried again, but added several 
further issues: 1. actually the 
starting point was the ""undo"" function (that we 
came up with a different name afterwards), that this function should do the 
query again - it was me who extrapolated that to the commit - is this really 
desired to after commit see changes done by different users? and 2. doing the 
complete query again after commit would mean newly inserted records being 
sorted to the place they belong instead of the place they were originally 
inserted, so it would look to the user as if the record ""jumped"" 
to a different place. Also, 3. what 
about those records that were inserted or changed in a way that they don't 
match the query? would they disappear after the commit?.","2006-04-12","112"
"2522","1121","2","Jason Cater (jcater) noted that the last query 
is already saved since if you press the 
""Query"" button twice, the previous query is brought back 
up, so users could re-run the query manually to see what had 
changed if they wanted to. On the more general issue, 
my personal feeling is in several key forms, my 
users will get disoriented if the resultset changes on them - but I can 
see where it would be useful/desirable too. Certainly it wouldn't be hard 
to add a requery-on-commit attribute to datasources or blocks (is there 
not one now?). But even then, the question becomes ""what is the 
default?"".","2006-04-12","112"
"2523","1121","3","James Thompson (jamest) said what's the 
advantage to the requery of the whole result set? (other than it would make 
our record tracking and removal code go away :) But Jason was not 
sure of this last point - as even on requery, 
wouldn't you want it to still try to make a best-effort to go back to the 
same record? Reinhard said that the 
advantage would be that you see other records 
that other users have added meanwhile - or changes from other users - 
(current requery logic only requeries those records that had changes on 
commit). James wondered if that 
shouldn't be a separate feature - like in postgresql's case it allows 
you to register for notifications of table updates.","2006-04-12","112"
"2524","1121","4","Reinhard was also interested in what you 
think about this ""revert"" function: should it revert to the 
original state of the db, or should it fetch changes from other transactions?
I think new records popping up on revert might not disorient as much as it 
would on commit but worried *sigh* 
why does it happen so often that I start implementing something and after 
that, I find out that I'm not even sure what exactly I want to 
implement.....","2006-04-12","112"
"2525","1121","5","Two 
days later, Bajusz Tamás (btami) explained that some of his users 
were having problems adjusting to using a legacy application, now 
translated to use GNUe Forms, because of the behaviour of the 'Clear' 
button. The 'clear' button threw away all changes since the last 
commit, not just on the current record. Also, it did not 
re-query the data, leaving the user looking at a blank form. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted that 
both issues are actually related 
to the ""undo"" function, and not to commit in any 
way. This meant that the behaviour of commit could 
stay as it was as of time of writing, avoiding some of the 
potential problems previously discussed. The main outstanding 
issue was whether the 'undo' function should 
revert to the state of the result 
set before any change was made - or should it refresh data 
from the backend - risking that, for example, the current 
record suddenly disappears because another user has just 
deleted it - or records ""jumping around"" because 
somebody changed a record in a way relevant for the sort 
order.","2006-04-12","112"
"2526","1122","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted that the <menu> tag 
seems to fulfill both fuctions: menu 
and menuitem - is that on purpose? James Thompson 
(jamest) confessed not a lot was 
done in menus beyond playing around - there is a pretty complete 
dynamic menu system in designer fwiw - that I was going to rip out 
and put into common to replace the stuff started there.
Reinhard looked at this, and noted that it seems 
to deal with the UI creation for the menu - which leads to the question
- does the menu handling actually belong to common or to forms?
James thought that the toolbar and menu 
logic for setting up menus belongs in common, or even in 
his new, proposed, GNUe Application Platform (GAP), as discussed in 
 - 
as it should be the same code in all 
our gui apps. It had been a while since he had looked at 
this code, but i think the addFoo methods 
built a in memory representation of a menu - and then the finialize 
method mapped it to the UI widget set. what I was hoping for in common 
was a set of classes/methods that let us build a logical menu in 
memory. Just like a GNUe form definition, this would not 
be specific to any particular user interface. The idea would be that 
the UI would register to listen for menu 
update events, thus completely isolating the menu logic from 
whatever user interface the user happened to be using.","2006-04-13","112"
"2527","1122","2","Reinhard asked whether this would also apply to the 'standard' 
menu items that were actually part of the base Forms application, as well 
as to additional menu items defined by a forms developer. James 
thought so - this would mean that 1) a form 
could extend a menu or remove items or hide them via startup triggers 
- 2) it may be possible for an application like navigator to adjust 
it's menu dynamically based upon the forms loaded in memory. 
Reinhard understood - the issue then was whether to implement this as 
UI events or as function calls by the menu code - 
my experience 
so far is that events add complexity and eat performance. 
James agreed, and although he had been thinking originally in terms 
of events, could see no reason not to do this as function calls 
instead.","2006-04-13","112"
"2528","1122","3","Reinhard liked James' idea of allowing triggers to be switched 
on and off. Jason Cater (jcater) wondered what should then 
happen if a disabled trigger is called
- does it just not run? - throw an exception? He felt the 
latter option might be better - it represented 
a developer error. James suggested
you could flip optional processing 
on/off via a checkbox on a form via a trigger disabling another named 
trigger. Reinhard felt this was bad style - it was better 
to keep the trigger active, but make it 
check the value of the check box in the 
trigger code and simply do nothing if that was what was 
required.","2006-04-13","112"
"2529","1122","4","Later, Reinhard added the more I 
think about menus and toolbars, the more I see them bound rather 
tightly to triggers - they will fire triggers, they will follow 
trigger's enabling/disabling ... they might even get label and help 
text from triggers (so a menu item and its corresponding toolbar 
button will get the same label/tooltip). So I'm starting to think if 
implementation of GMenu, GMenuItem and GToolButton would feel well 
in the logic/ subdirectory. Jason noted that 
fwiw, this is how designer does it - 
and how I was moving forms to do it. And user interface 
systems such as QT did something similar - 
except they all have ""Events"" 
instead of ""Triggers"" - so 
I think having one object that represents any type of such 
""action"" makes sense. This would also automatically 
handle the different ways of selecting something in a typical graphical 
user interface - pressing a hot key, selecting a menu option or 
clicking a toolbar icon are all the same 
object - my only concern is are we overloading triggers too 
much. In particular, all of the GNUe Tools had the 
concept of triggers, but this more specific use of them 
for the menu/toolbar/ui stuff
really only made sense in forms (and maybe 
navigator).","2006-04-13","112"
"2530","1122","5","Jason and Reinhard swapped some sample XML to try to clarify 
what they each meant. Jason suggested what 
I now wish we had done (and might could still do without any 
breakage) was that triggers could just be stand-alone pieces 
of python code with a name, which could be called either by another 
trigger bound to an object (what GNUe had, up until now, considered a 
trigger) or called by an action. This would simplify Reinhard's 
suggested treatment of menu items, in that these would just be a 
specific type of action. ","2006-04-13","112"
"2531","1122","6","Reinhard set out the options - either a) 
a menu item has an ON-ACTIVATE trigger that is 
fired when the item is clicked, and that trigger is just a trigger 
like all other triggers, or b) there are <action>s, and a menu 
item is bound to an action, and gets info like icon, label, help text 
from that action element, and an action is, while in implementation 
closely related to a trigger, something completely different in 
philosophy. The more I think about it the more it seems to me these 
are diametral concepts.. Jason liked this 
second option - it seems like a clean 
distiction as far as the definition of our markup.","2006-04-13","112"
"2532","1123","1","Jason Cater (jcater) asked how far are we 
featurewise from considering a 1.0 release for GNUe Forms.

made no difference to him, but it maybe affected 
others' willingness to use GNUe. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
said there is one psychological thing 
here for me - as long as we are 0.x I feel like having the right to 
break compatibility - as soon as we are 1.0 I think we morally have 
the obligation to stay compatible with every single feature or 
misfeature that is in the code. I seriously would like to see a 0.9 
or comparable being in use for > 6 months without much happening - so 
we know it's stable enough, both in terms of bugs and in 
terms of not needing new features that would break 
backward-compatability.","2006-04-13","112"
"2533","1124","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted that 
each object in the trigger 
namespace has a _parent property - do you make use of that 
in any way? James Thompson (jamest) said that he 
did not use this when coding his triggers - 
i believe i always use absolute 
reference from form in the format 
form.block.field. 
Reinhard also asked I 
figure that you also don't make use of the _object property 
of trigger objects that let you directly access the GObj 
object that should actually be hidden behind it. 
James confirmed this - he personally had never 
been keen on this, but it had been added 
for papo folks, as previously discussed in several threads, including 
.
","2006-04-14","112"
"2534","1124","2","James explained that i see the trigger 
namespace as ideally being a restricted python environment with 
control over imports, with code for triggers 
having no access to the GObjs, only to 
instances of the class that implements the namespace representation 
of that object in the trigger. He added 
there is a class that maps a var name 
in the trigger to an object - and controlls access to that object 
via the exposed properties - methods, etc. Reinhard 
identified this as GObjNamespace - 
exactly the class I'm cleaning up as of time of writing - 
thus all these questions.","2006-04-14","112"
"2535","1124","3","The 
next day, Reinhard noted that, previously, any 
trigger got a copy of the __dict__ of the ""self"" object into its local 
namespace - so for a block trigger, you could do either self.firstRecord() or 
just firstRecord(). I removed that as I considered it a bug, but now I'm not 
sure if it is wanted behaviour. In any case I don't like it very much as it 
allows for sloppy programming - and it will most probably hurt the ""support 
for self in named triggers"" todo item. Anyway, if anybody knows some 
background why this was done, I'd be happy to know :)","2006-04-14","112"
"2536","1125","1","After a long discussion about using pylint to help enforce coding 
standards for GNUe (and hence minimise the number of bugs), 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked about 
trigger namespace, as previously discussed in 
. 
He had originally changed the code to require references to trigger
objects in the current Form to be in the format 'formname.object()' 
or 'self.object()', rather than just 'object()'. But he had changed 
this back again pending further discussion, for fear of breaking 
all of James Thompson's (jamest) existing form designs. James said 
that, in forms that he had designed, he normally used the 
fully-qualified 'formname.object()' syntax anyway, not either 
'self.object()' or 'object()' - he had found that these last two 
had proved problematical in the past. Reinhard noted 
any feedback welcome - I think nobody 
uses triggers as much as you do. James confessed 
i luvs my triggers.","2006-04-18","113"
"2537","1125","2","The 
next day, Reinhard noted that self 
in named triggers now works fine - it's always the object that fired 
the trigger. Jason Cater (jcater) gave an 
example where the same trigger code might be fired from different 
objects in different blocks. Reinhard agreed that 
you wouldn't use ""self"" in such 
a case - except for maybe debugging-like purposes (i.e. to 
find out which object had called the trigger). Jason suggested using 
an idea from Zope, and having both self == what 
the trigger is ""bound"" to and 
context == what is calling the 
trigger. Reinhard felt 'self' might be better to refer 
to the object calling the trigger, not the object containing 
the trigger code - anybody writing 
the trigger code *knows* where he puts it but 
if the trigger can be fired from 
different objects - there is no way of finding out from where it was 
fired except by checking. Jason was not disputing that 
knowing what called the trigger was typically more important, he 
was just questioning whether ""self"" 
has a loaded meaning and would confuse those beginning to code 
gnue triggers.","2006-04-18","113"
"2538","1125","3","Jason also noted that the cool part 
about that is if you have code that needs to happen both on a 
pre-insert and a pre-update - but only a few lines of the code is 
different - you could have one block of trigger code that 
used self.action to find out why it had been called and 
branch accordingly.","2006-04-18","113"
"2539","1125","4","The 
next day, James noted that in 
the old forms namespace - you could do a startup trigger that 
declared a global object and used it to import a module of trigger code, 
which was then available globally to any other trigger in the form. 
that no longer works - which will break a 
ton of stuff for me :) Reinhard said 
it actually works for me - I wonder, 
does your case invove any dialogs? As he wondered if 
James' problems could be a side-effect of when 
dialogs got their own global 
namespace.","2006-04-18","113"

wonder whether you use manually created GTrigger instances - 
(i.e. not defined in an XML file such as a .gfd GNUe Form 
Definition or .grd GNUe Report definition), noting that 
GTrigger.__init__ provides a way to 
directly initialize with type, name, text, language - which would 
only make sense at all if an instance is created manually.
James Thompson (jamest) said that iirc 
we wanted triggers to be useful outside of xml files - we've just 
never documented the feature so no one does it I'd imagine. 
Reinhard was not sure if it would be 
easy to use triggers outside XML files anyway - as much of the 
trigger code is tightly connected with GObj et al. James 
noted that one possible use for triggers not in an XML file 
would be unit testing, as discussed in 
.","2006-04-19","113"

GParserMultiplexor code in GNUe Common was for. Jason Cater
(jcater) explained that GBinary is a way 
to store images, etc, in an XML file - it would save an icon or 
whatever resource in mime64 (or whatever) - for example, 
for use in GNUe Reports. However, GParserMultiplexor was now 
redundant - python's new-style classes 
would've done what I was going to do with GParserMultiplexor - 
so even if I got back around to that, it'd be done 
differently. Reinhard volunteered to remove this.","2006-04-19","113"
"2542","1128","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked about the 
concept behind GObj and ParserObject - or, more specifically - 
where ParserObject ends and where GObj starts. 
Jason Cater (jcater) said that the basic principle was that 
ParserObj is anything that could be 
represented by XML - including GObjects, text content, and xml 
comments - and GObjects are strictly objects that are of concern 
to a GNUe document. He clarified that originally 
ParserObj just held code that was 
shared by GObj and GContent - but it seems to have grown in 
scope since.","2006-04-19","113"
"2543","1128","2","Reinhard explained that his reason for asking was that 
I have been playing with the idea 
of extracting some stuff from there into a new class hierarchy 
that might be reusable for other stuff. Jason said that 
he would love to see the separation of 
the document structure and the document storage logic - right 
now GObjects are really xml-centric, from their creation to the 
way data is stored in them. But I've 
always envisioned GNUe supporting storage ""formats"" other 
than XML - such as storing in a database table (and I don't just 
mean storing marshalled XML). But even if we never did support 
more than XML - I'd like GObject creation in Python scripts to be 
a little cleaner and less XML-specific.","2006-04-19","113"
"2544","1128","3","Reinhard explained what he had been thinking about - 
1. a base class for a tree structure, 
providing everything that deals with the tree structure in 
principle, like getParent, getChildren, children iterators, 
walk(), findParentOfType etc - 2. derived from that, a class that 
adds XML on top of it, adding things like parser magic, dumpXML, 
namespace magic etc - 3. on top of that, a class that adds in other 
stuff used in gnue, like triggers, namespaces, events - 4. a GObj 
to remain compatible with the old structure. He noted 
1 & 2 could be completely independent 
of the rest of gnue - so it might match your goal by at least 
having all XML related issues in a single place - and it might also 
match jamest's long term idea of ""decoupling"" gnue-common 
parts from each other.","2006-04-19","113"
"2545","1128","4","James Thompson (jamest) said that i'd 
thought about 1 at the least - as gobj is bloated - and I'd think 
it usefull for the base of menus and such. Reinhard 
noted that including item 4 would allow for backwards-compatability, 
at least in the medium term. Jason noted I 
have a laundry list of things I wish were done differntly with 
GObjects - but couldn't change as it'd break stuff - (but you're 
proposing a migration object, so I can wish out loud now :).
Reinhard and Jason discussed some detailed tidying-up that they 
would like to do, now that breaking compatability with the old 
GObject was not an issue, finding that they had very similar 
ideas in most cases.","2006-04-19","113"
"2546","1128","5","Reinhard added that he would like 
objects to be more ""self-contained"" and 
""self-defined"", in that 
classes could have class variables 
defining what we now have in getXMLelements. Jason agreed - 
it would keep designer cleaner - 
as designer uses those attributes a lot. James felt 
that should make the G*Parser unnecessary 
in most cases I would imagine - at least the huge arse 
dict. Jason noted that originally, 
GParser was very simple and loaded and XML file and created GObjects
- not much else - but the definition dicts were expanded to include 
parent information, requirements, defaults, etc - because designer 
needed that information - but GParser was never updated to enforce 
what the definition dict listed (I fully intended to, just never got 
around to it). Reinhard fully appreciated 
that it's a system that has grown - 
probably grown much over what it was designed for from the start in 
many aspects - and I'm proud that I'm the one to get the honor of 
restructuring these aspects to be clean again.","2006-04-19","113"
"2547","1128","6","Jason was so glad appserver is 
python/gnue-common based now, in line with the other 
GNUe Tools - it had originally been a stand-alone tool written 
in C. Reinhard asked are you sure? I 
would probably never have touched gnue-common otherwise ;-) 
Jason admitted that the one crappy part of 
changing GParser - is that I have quite a few projects inhouse that 
use GParser to create object trees - that I haven't looked at in ages
(but just work). Reinhard said that these 
might generate usable feedback - 
if these projects turn out to become easiser, more straightforward 
with the new classes, the it's good - if things get more complicated 
with the new classes, we have wrong design decisions. In 
any case, having a GObj to remain compatible with the old structure, 
as discussed above, should make a soft 
break for the ""logic"" changes - i.e. gnue-common should be 
100% compatible for now - I have planned to add depreciation warnings 
for old stuff with gnue-common 0.7 - and remove depreciated stuff 
with 0.8 - which will be not earlier than in a year or two - so 
people really have time to convert their apps.","2006-04-19","113"

validating the typecasts in fields

- 'datetime' is not valid for typecast-attribute which allows these 
values only: 'Default', 'Description', 'ValueSet', 'Typecase', 
'Label'. Johannes Vetter (johannesV) said 
this is because the options defined in 
a ValueSet will be checked now. James agreed, but said that 
the error message was wrong - the list of allowed values
look more like gparse dict keys 
than a list of valid data types. Johannes found and fixed this bug.","2006-04-20","113"
"2550","1129","2","Later, James noted that the list of valid data types was 
just date, text, number, adding

a trigger is defined within a <dialog>, what should

should point to the dialog form - all <dialog> is is an alias for 
<form type=""dialog""> or some such. Reinhard 
noted that this would mean there would 
be no way to access the main form from within a dialog. James 
said that the proper way for a dialog box to communicate with the form 
that called it was via the activateDialog() 
function. This was so that dialogs 
would be self contained with a standard API. That way, the same 
dialog could easily be hooked into multiple forms if required.","2006-04-20","113"

, 
Jason Cater (jcater) clarified that he had suggested that 
""self"" could refer to neither the trigger's owner nor to the trigger's 
caller - but to the event itself. So self.action could be what action is being 
performed, self.parent could be the trigger's owner, and self.context could be the 
caller. In other words, I was presenting a 3rd 
alternative where self referred to something specific to the trigger.","2006-04-26","114"

with a grid of multiple rows of data - when 
shift-tabing backwards it jumps up and down between 3 rows

(reinhard) said it sounded like a bug in 
display handler.","2006-04-27","114"
"2554","1133","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) explained 
the idea behind filters is to 
implement things like multi company - you have a table 
""company"" that contains the companies - and all other tables 
have a foreign key to the company table. You select the company you want 
to work in at startup or you can even define it in your connections.conf 
- and you will only see the records for your company. 
Malek Hadj-Ali (lekma) asked why is getFilters 
language dependant? wondering whether he could 
use filters to rule out all record that are 
not in my locale? Reinhard said this was certainly possible, but the 
more basic reason why filters were language dependent was because the name of 
the object being filtered on would be different in different locales - 
for example, for German it will not be 
""Company"" but ""Firma"". He noted that 
you can find example for filters 
in gnue-luca (as referred to in 
).","2006-05-02","115"
"2555","1133","2","Malek asked how to supply the filter value to the Application Server. 
Reinhard explained that, for example, if 
you have a filter=""base_lang"", appserver creates the field 
implicitly and on login, you 
give base_lang = <the gnue_id of the language you want to 
have>. Malek asked how he would know 
which gnue id to supply. Reinhard 
replied that's the purpose 
of getFilters - it gets you the valid values with their respective 
gnue_id. The idea is that you can, on the front end, display a dropdown 
with the values - and let the user select, and then send the 
corresponding gnue_id at login. The reason for using getFilters 
rather than just querying the table or class that contained the possible 
values for the filter was that the class  
could have dozens of fields so 
you needed a mechanism to decide which 
of these fields you want to see in the login dialog for the user 
to select from - you see only those 
fields that have a search= property. This was similar to the way 
the search= property was used in Forms, to determine which field or 
fields were displayed as the pick-list in dropdown selection fields.","2006-05-02","115"
"2556","1133","3","Ealier, Malek had asked is there a way to 
bypass a filter? Reinhard explained 
you can bypass a filter by explicitly 
including the filter property into the condition tree. The way 
that filters were implemented was that normally 
appserver implicitly adds a ""... 
and filter_property = filter_value"" to the end 
of all queries. But it only did this if 
the condition does not contain any reference to the filter 
property already. So putting in your own, explicit, condition 
on filter_property that was always true (e.g. filter_property IS NOT 
NULL) would bypass the filter and show you all records.","2006-05-02","115"
"2557","1133","4","Reinhard also explained that some of the apparent complexity of the 
filter-realted code was an attempt to deal with multi-level filters, such 
as language and dialect. You might need to first of all select a language 
(e.g. English), and then select the dialect (e.g. British English or 
American English).","2006-05-02","115"
"2558","1133","5","He admitted that there was more work to do on filters, 
but I think in basic 
principle, it's usable and the right direction. When the time 
came to play around with the login 
process a little more, when we want to add real security to 
appserver, that might well also be the time to 
think the filter stuff 
through again.","2006-05-02","115"
"2559","1133","6","He added that, in terms of security for Application Server, 
I would prefer login methods that don't 
send passwords over the net - so we would either need a wrapper that 
encrypts passwords client side and decrypts server side - or use an 
authentication system that is secure as such. I've been thinking TLS, 
SASL, Kerberos, GSSAPI and a lot of other buzzwords, but I need to read 
deeper into it to see what fits with what we actually need - but that's 
down the road anyway.","2006-05-02","115"

make a little app to calculate sales quotes, asking 
Do I need to create database records for

a database of prices, discounts, schedules 
etc - I'm just wondering if I need that to be created as a group of 
records in the database in order to get it as an output or if I can 
get it directly from the forms client somehow? James Thompson 
(jamest) recommended saving the details of the quotes generated 
in any case - as i always get hit up for it 
later - people want that history 
here at times of previous quotations provided.","2006-05-03","115"
"2561","1134","2","More generally, he explained in some 
of my forms i have a trigger do the work, store the record(s), then 
call a python app to generate the output form. This 
was then passed to a python app 
that uses reportlab 
to build the output. However, you could also produce output 
this way without saving the data to a database first. This was 
like my packing slips, the gnue-form 
frontend isn't directly bound to any tables - the shipping guys fill 
in the form, press a complete button. my output looks nothing like the 
form - as it adds company logo, barcodes, extra info the shippers don't 
enter. This was a fairly simple application - a 463 line 
GNUe Form Definition (.gfd), plus about 100 lines of python for the 
triggers.","2006-05-03","115"
"2562","1134","3","Nick explained his requirements - essentialy 
the sales person selects a discount/pricing schedule, and then adds items 
to a list which have this pricing schedule applied to them - if they don't 
specify an exact count they can select a quantity break - if they specify 
an exact count for every item then it caries over the price and 
totals. Then at the end they click a done 
button or whatever and it outputs a nice pdf of the quote for the 
customer. Why he was interested in using GNUe Forms was that 
it'd be nice if they could see the items as they 
are added and then be able to at least delete them if they make a 
mistake.","2006-05-03","115"
"2563","1134","4","James Thompson said that another option 
if forms is too rough would be a small custom app based upon gnue-common - 
i do that for more complex tools like our scanner app and order processing

via Forms or Reports) to present a QT designer 
built UI to the user - access to our datasources - basic argument parsing - 
the debug and profiling stuff.","2006-05-03","115"
"2564","1134","5","He explained that forms is mainly a data-aware 
front end that provides basic input manipulation, validation, and

dynamically change the UI layout currenlty. He confessed 
for me I use forms more than I should - 
as it presents a common interface to most our apps - but if you need areas to 
expand and contract then forms won't fly as of time of writing. Nick 
felt that forms needs a data table widget. 
James said we're talking about adding 
a table widget - but really other than looks the rows= tag that already 
existed does the same thing.

that schemas were normally stored in .gcd (GNUe Class Definition) files, 
as used by the Application Server. GNUe Small Business did not have 
these, as it did not intend to use appserver

the form builder/interface components. 
if you are looking for a complete financials 
package, then GNUe is not ready for you as of time of writing.

easily build an interface to your own database, then gnue

"2567","1137","1","Malek Hadj-Ali (lekma) reported after 
benchmarking a little bit the appserver, i got some ugly 
results. The bottleneck appeared to be in the XML-RPC (remote 
procedure call) code rather than in the application server itself. So 
Malek had searched for an alternative to 
xmlrpc and finally found a spec 
for a binary rpc protocol, that was partly implemented in 
python, called hessian. 
He re implemented it in python 
taking care to keep the api 
the same as for the existing XML-RPC used by GNUe. The 
results are: the encoding part is 
slightly slower than xmlrpc - the decoding is way faster than xmlrpc
- so on the overall hessian is faster. However, Reinhard 
Müller (reinhard) was still concerned about the loss in performance 
compared to just running a query directly against the database - 
xmlrpc adds an overhead of 20000% - 
and hessian adds an overhead of 6000% - which both are disgusting 
numbers :(.","2006-05-10","116"
"2568","1137","2","In any case, the simple fact that 
appserver itself (without the rpc protocol) adds 4000 % overhead

odd is that I think we did performance tests and they were 
acceptable. Johannes Vetter (johannesV) wondered if 
maybe the number of records was too 
low then, noting that the GNUe Schema Definition (.gsd)
format has shown to be not very well 
suited for large files. Malek confirmed that generating 
the gsd file seemed to be the bottleneck.","2006-05-10","116"
"2569","1137","3","Malek sent his sample data and code to Johannes, who ran them 
himself, and got even more extreme results - just over a second 
for running a query directly against the database, and almost 18 
minutes going via Application Server and XML-RPC. Malek said that 
he had dug into the code enough to determine that 
the for loop in fetch is the 
killer, but did not understand the GNUe code internals 
enough to progress any further. Reinhard said that the data 
from the database should only be being fetched once and then 
cached before being processed to XML-RPC - 
it might be a good idea to check 
postgresql logs to see if the sql statements against the db are 
those that we would expect - acually finding out that a bug 
somewhere causes a new sql statement to be issued for every 
record would be an easy eplanation of the bad performance, 
and should be fixable - but i fear it's not that 
easy.... Johannes confirmed from the database 
logs that only one SQL statement was being generated.","2006-05-10","116"

next day, Malek reported my hessian

is good for network. He confirmed there were no new 
external dependencies in the code - he had implemented the 
hessian protocol directly within the existing GNUe code base.","2006-05-10","116"
"2572","1137","6","The
next day, Reinhard developed further optimisation improvements. 
Previously, GNUe had been using 
the same datasources library for forms and appserver 
but this had a lot of overhead 
that was only for forms - like tracking dirty records, caching, 
etc. For Application Server, these sorts of issues 
were anyway done in appserver 
itself. So he had written a more 'raw' ResultSet 
function, removing this overhead, which Application Server 
could then use directly. He added as 
a side effect, it should also greatly reduce the memory 
footprint.","2006-05-10","116"

Malek Hadj-Ali (lekma) reported the script that 
use to take 4min+ is now under 2. There were still some
strange bugs in http 1.1 with hessian 
and the request still eats 300Meg of 
memory. But, as Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted 
at least for speed we're not magnitudes 
away any more. Malek did further testing, and noted that a 
hessian dump run independantly took a fraction of a second - the 
same hessian dump via the GNUe Application Server took 26 seconds. 
Reinhard noted that it was not unusual to see odd results like this when 
profiling python code - I suspect 
all the hidden python magic like garbage collection and the like 
has a big impact on performance - and the decision when exactly 
python runs the garbage collection might depend on conditions that 
we as humans would regard as ""random"". Jason Cater
(jcater) wondered if using unicode, or the presence of the python psyco 
module was making a difference, but neither of these proved to be the 
case. Both Jason and Reinhard volunteered to have a look at Malek's 
code to see if they could spot anything.","2006-05-16","117"

more tests with various different combinations (using XML-RPC, 
hessian and direct database access, both with and without 
GNUe Application Server) and found that hessian was still 
somewhat faster than the original XML-RPC protocol 
that GNUe had been using previously, but felt a bit frustrated 
that it should be significantly faster - as 
pure dumps/loads is around 3 times 
faster in hessian than xmlrpc.","2006-05-16","117"

conmfirmed this - I wrapped the calls into the 
hotshot profiler the other day - and noticed that most of the wait was 
inside of the networking code of hessianlib.py. Malek pointed  
out that appserver adds a non negligeabable 
overhead in ClientAdapter and ServerAdapter, regardless of 
whether hessian or XML-RPC was used, but 
it tries hard to balance this overhead with agressive http 1.1 
connections - so all in all it's not that bad..","2006-05-16","117"

is forms head? and the wx driver in particular - 2.6 as 
the dropdowns in the old wx driver have 
started causing us lots of issues. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
replied head should be perfectly usable, 
and wx26 should be possibly the most stable driver of all 
(as previously discussed in 

and similar threads). But he cautioned that this did not mean 
that you *won't* hit bugs.... 
James tried it, and noted 2.6 computes 
spacing a bit different than 2.4 did doesn't it? Johannes Vetter 
(johannesV) explained spacing depends on the 
biggest control possible - depending on the platform used. 
Reinhard clarified it just takes standard 
entry size, standard button size, standard dropdown size - and takes the 
biggest of them - so no control will get chopped. James was concerned
that this really increases the horizontal space 
usage though - like on a rows=10 - it looking like whitespace is 
doubled.","2006-05-22","117"

need to take account of what X themes the user was running - 
as for whatever reason themes effect forms 
here - a form that fits on user A's screen doesn't on User B's.

Both projects are similar on some points. Derek 
Neighbours (derek) said gnue 
really is a framework at this point w/o an ERP application 
(though reinhard is moving in that direction) - tiny erp 
seems to have erp type software. is tiny erp wanting to 
move to the gnue platform?","2006-05-23","118"

by a message on the Tiny ERP discussion forum that 
mentioned
GNUe. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) agreed 
that tiny erp and gnue have 
many similar approaches - however, I have looked a bit at 
tinyerp's code and I don't see many possibilities of sharing 
*code* at this point - what we could think about is, IMHO, 
sharing *ideas* or maybe even interfaces. Fabien 
felt that this was sensible - for 
example, about one year ago, I though that using GNUe's designer 
could be a good idea to design our views (we still not have a 
designer for our views). Although 
both project are mature and 
too advanced to change design architecture it was 
still possible that some 
external part could be shared.","2006-05-23","118"

GNUe could use our report engine based on OpenOffice without 
modifing GNUe parts (it is independant of Tiny ERP) - 
he pointed 
to a flash demo. However, Tiny ERP were now 
thinking about creating a 
complete BI program in Python to allow On-Line 
Analytical Processing (OLAP) and data mining. This might be 
of interest to GNUe as well. Later, Reinhard noted that 
you might consider using parts 
of gnue-common for that, which would gain you database 
independence out of the box.","2006-05-23","118"

had already pointed quite 
some people to tinyerp that were looking for a turnkey

"2586","1142","1","Fabien Pinckaers (pinky) asked Is 
it possible the use some part of GNUe without the whole GNUe 
framework ? (like report designer for instance) Peter 
Sullivan (psu) confirmed this - GNUe 
Common has all the shared stuff - other than than, just use what 
you need - a very simple app in GNUe might just need Forms - 
or you can add Reports, Navigator, App Server and have it all 
singing all dancing. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) 
confirmed the idea behind gnue is 
that you can use it 2 ways - a) front-end (forms, reports) -> 
database - b) front-end -> appserver -> database. 
This was because you can build simple 
apps where you put all the logic in the forms and the reports - 
as many real life gnue based applications are very small sized 
few table few forms apps. But 
for bigger apps you can choose 
to put logic in appserver since 
appserver then behaves like a 
database on crack (as somebody put it here) - you can define 
triggers and calculated fields with arbitary python code - 
but still you can use the same front end tools like gnue-
forms, gnue-reports, gnue-designer for both kinds of 
projects.","2006-05-23","118"

Reinhard Müller (reinhard) passed on 
some further info about 
performance issues in appserver and in gnue in general - 
over the weekend I was having a talk with another 
developer that was fighting performance issues in python, and 
this developer had the very same problem that garbage collection 
is *the* performance killer in python and close to impossible to 
optimize as it runs just at random times and it can't be easily 
found out which function causes which garbage. Derek 
Neighbours (derek) pointed to a good 
article 
on this subject that gave 
examples on how to avoid object churning. However, he 
noted that when we chose python 
the primary reason was - python values productivity over 
performance :) - is gnue to a point where it needs to consider 
optimization?. Jason Cater (jcater) did not think so - 
I think the question just came up in 
the context of some tests someone was doing with a new comm 
backend.","2006-05-30","118"
"2588","1144","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) had been 
playing around with dynamic menus lately. Currently you can have 
<menu> and <menuitem> tags in your GNUe Form Definition 
file (.gfd) that are added to the main 
menu. But we've once talked about making it possible to replace/hide 
standard menu items by putting some magic in the gfd. So I thought 
about introducing a config file with the xml code of the standard 
menu and the standard toolbar - which would be merged with the menu 
given in the gfd, with the .gfd version taking priority 
over the config file's defaults. This would allow both the standard 
menu items, plus any additional menu items specific to that form, 
to be merged into a single XML 
tree In fact, he confessed the 
starting point was common handling of standard menu and custom menu 
as well as ""not hardcoding things"" for the 
standard menu - and being able to 
site-customize menus is only an interesting side effect. 
James Thompson (jamest) did not see 
a problem putting it in a file and I could see some 
advantages.","2006-06-06","120"

todo list, but with lower priority.","2006-06-09","120"
"2590","1145","2","Reinhard said that what he liked about GNUe was that 
it is still the only way I know that gives you 
platform independence *and* backend independence at the same time - 
you could use it with any operating system and any database -

the only negative was that GNUe was still not 
yet 1.0 if you understand what I mean - there might be some features missing,

1.0 what we would have called 0.4 ;-).","2006-06-09","120"

"2592","1146","1","James Thompson (jamest) noted i'm 
running 30 person call center w/ gnue based apps - but we're an 
LTSP shop. He had three 
medium-sized servers and people pick their 
login machine at startup all of which run 
kde + a java app + gnue based apps for multiple people - the machine I'm 
logged into now has 8 people using it as of time of writing. 
There was also a seperate, slightly larger, server 
containing the postgresql DB. This meant that if one of 
the LTSP servers locks up or the hardware 
fails only the users logged into that box are effected - they reset 
their ltsp terminal and the process is repeated with less machines avail. 
I've blown a NIC and left the machine offline for a few weeks without 
issue. I also run one machine as our test login box. Users are welcome 
to use it like any other but i'll initially install new stuff there - 
and if issues arrise (say a new version of gnue breaks 2 or 3 forms 
only 1 person uses) then that person avoids the test box - until I 
resolve the issue, they test again, and the updates are pushed to all 
machines. He commented this setup 
works really well for us - as our login servers aren't high end, our 
terminals are $50 old dells or compaqs purchased from a reseller 
- it's a poor mans high availability for 
a call center :).","2006-06-09","120"

Bajusz Tamás (btami) said that data for the form on the client 
was sent using xml-rpc.
Reinhard explained gnue-forms calls 
a RPC function on appserver, then appserver sends the form as the 
function result. However, the server did not refresh 
data in the form if it changes - in 
fact clients work in isolated transactions - i.e. you don't see 
changes made by other clients unless you explicitly commit or 
refresh your transaction - which is, BTW, how I really think it 
should be.","2006-06-12","120"

ideas, how to improve the webclient. Derek said that 
currently we are using a lot of ruby 
on rails - i think it does a lot of things well, but it still 
doesnt solve my primary problems :) He noted 
they have something like gnue designer 
wizards (only for web) called scaffolding that is interesting - and 
their active record stuff is similar to gnue-common. Certainly RoR 
has brought web applications very much into the future 
but it still misses the mark to be a 
specific enough framework to churn out enterprise applications. 
Jan said recently I read a comparison 
between RoR and Zope. Both would be application frameworks, which 
would promote a programming language. And users would learn first 
about the framework and then start to use the language. 
Derek felt that was fair - there is 
much talk about how pretty and perfect ruby is.... but personally 
it reminds me of perl - only with a good object model - of course 
i liked object pascal so what do i know? He added 
dont get me wrong, ruby is really quite 
nice, but i dont think it this elegant thing of beauty people claim it

the size of the box on the screen - not the

it might be a bad idea how the connection trigger

i would still imagine it's something 
funky I'm doing in the form rather than a problem with

the mouse-click is sent to (and handled by) the parent-window. 
He confirmed that, when using the user interface drivers on Microsoft 
Windows and Mac OS X, the focus stayed on the dialog box, and 
correctly ignored any clicks on the parent form. Reinhard wondered if 
this was a problem specific to the GTK2 desktop he was using under

"2604","1154","1","It was asked whether having an object ID field was necessary for databases being 
accessed by GNUe. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said we 
currently depend on oids - because they are the only way of safely identifying a 
new record that has just been inserted if the primary key has been set by a db 
trigger. It was pointed out that, with Oracle at least, database-generated 
object IDs were not guranteed to remain the same over time. James Thompson 
(jamest) had not heard this, but in any case pointed out that 
postgresql 8.1 has depreciated the OID and no longer 
created them on tables unless specifically told too during the create table 
statemnet - this burns me quite a bit :) However, he had been under the 
impression that the data access code for GNUe only 
used the OID if a PK field wasn't defined for that table - if you 
defined what field or fields made up the primary key as part of the datasource 
definition, it would use these instead of requiring an object ID. 
He did this all the time with things like RMA numbers or order numbers - 
the user doesn't enter the PK value nor does the 
form - they save the new record and then the rma number assigned just pops up on 
their screen in the uneditable field :). This would normally be done by 
automatically re-querying the record after save - but

insert. Reinhard confirmed this.","2006-06-26","122"

(maybe reportlab) based solution. Tamás felt it would be 
better to use/enhance gnue-reports - if 
everyone using custom report solution, it will be never 
finished - as i see, the engine 
itself is ready, the filters need more work.","2006-07-06","122"
"2612","1158","1","Johannes Vetter (johannesV) had fixed a 
bug in the wx26-uidriver of the released version of GNUe Forms, 
and released the source-code version of this as an 'interim' 0.5.14a 
release. Bajusz Tamás (btami) packaged this up as a setup.exe 
release for Microsoft Windows, and made it available for download, noting 
that it doesn't contains wx26. Normally, 
the Microsoft Windows setup.exe releases would contain as many of the 
dependencies that it legally could. But wx version 2.6 had not been 
included in the last setup.exe release. GNUe Forms with wx 2.6 
was a significant improvement on using it with wx 2.4. But at the time of 
the last release, GNUe Designer had not been wx26 
ready. So the Microsoft Windows setup.exe version of that 
release had remained on wx version 2.4. This was still the case with this 
new interim 0.5.14a release. But if people wanted, they could manually 
configure GNUe to use wx 2.6 with Forms and wx 2.4 with Designer.","2006-07-18","123"

Bajusz Tamás (btami) felt that the 
new box layout is cool, what do you want to be enhance before new release?
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) said that Johannes Vetter (johannesV) 
still sees some stability problems - 
and he is currently working on the new grid widget - and we are cleaning 
up the general GF* code, which still takes some time.","2006-07-18","123"
"2614","1160","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked about focus triggers in GNUe Forms - 
it seems like navigating from one record to another 
(like scrolling to the next record) fires the FOCUS-OUT triggers for the block 
with the old record loaded - and the FOCUS-IN triggers for the block with the new 
record loaded. He understood the reasoning for having both focus-in 
and focus-out - you can do consistency 
checks in the focus-out trigger and the user can never navigate out of an 
""incomplete"" block. James Thompson (jamest) confirmed this, and noted 
that each type of focus trigger could be set at form, block or field level 
depending on the type of validation required. Reinhard 
understood this, but was more interested in the 
case when you don't move the cursor at all - but you just navigate to the next 
record - i.e. you *stay* in the same field, entry, and block - but the current 
record of the block changes. James thought that this should still fire 
the focus triggers. Reinhard agreed, however I found 
it does *only* fire the block level triggers not the entry-level or 
page-level triggers.","2006-09-13","124"
"2615","1160","2","James had not been aware that entry-level triggers and page-level triggers 
had been added - he was struggling to think of 
example off top of head where I'd need them vs a block or field level 
trigger. Reinhard wondered maybe they 
were done ""just to play safe"" when the distinction between a 
field and an entry was introduced. James agreed - it allowed developers, 
for instance, to have an entry-level trigger that would work on all instances 
of the same entry, even if they were in multiple fields on different pages of 
a multi-page form.","2006-09-13","124"
"2616","1160","3","Reinhard said that he would change the code to check focus-in and 
focus-out type triggers at all appropriate levels whenever the focus changed. 
He queried the order that the various types of trigger should be checked - he felt 
that it should be pre-focusout - pre-focusin - change 
focus - post-focusout - post-focusin. James agreed.","2006-09-13","124"
"2617","1160","4","Later, Reinhard noted that the order of triggers he had proposed 
turns out to be a lot trickier as it seems 
at first sight. The logic did not necessarily work, for 
instance, when inserting a new record. He could also foresee triggers 
conflicting with each other - for example if 
post-focusout says it's ok to lose focus but pre-focusin says ""i 
don't want it"". He wondered if it would be simpler to 
have fewer types of triggers - just a single 
on-focusout before creating or 
moving record, and on-focusin 
(which can not block) afterwards. Jason Cater (jcater) explained 
that the original rationale had been that pre-focusout 
could block - in fact, that would be its main 
purpose - but that then the others were called 
knowing that the focus was changing. In theory, any of the pre-focusout 
triggers at event, block or page level could refuse to allow the focus-out to 
happen (e.g. for data validation) - only if all the pre-focusout triggers at 
each level succeded were the post-focusout triggers at each level then checked. 
Reinhard noted that this meant running the 
post-focusout *before* the focus *really* leaves the entry/block 
doesn't hurt at all. Jason agreed - as we know 
that it will in fact leave the focus - only the pre-focusout 
triggers could actually block changing the focus.","2006-09-13","124"
"2618","1160","5","Reinhard noted that this actually meant keeping to the current order of trigger 
types - 1. pre-focusout - 2. post-focusout - 3. 
actually move around - 4. pre-focusin - 5. post-focusin - where only 1. can 
block. But at least he now understood the rationale behind this.","2006-09-13","124"
"2619","1161","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) noted that a lot of 
attributes of GFBlock and GFField are changeable in trigger namespace
and wondered what was the 
reasoning behind this. Jason Cater (jcater) explained 
at one time, our specifications for forms was that 
triggers could practically build a form at runtime and anything/everything was 
changable/scriptable - that was probably a pipe dream (and probably not necessary)
- but it's possible the code you saw was the start of that general trend.
Reinhard noted that the dream of building a form at 
runtime, whilst theoretically possible in a two-tier environment (GNUe Forms 
client talks directly to a database), wasn't really practicable in a three-tier 
environment (GNUe Forms client talks to GNUe Application Server talks to 
database), as there would be no mechanism for triggers in the GNUe Forms client 
to dynamically create new objects on the 
GNUe Application Server. He noted that, as of time of writing, 
*all* possible attributes of the 
<block> tag were exported to trigger namespace - autoCommit, queryable, 
editable, deletable, autoCreate, autoCommit, autoNextRecord, transparent - 
similar for GFField - maxLength, minLenght, queryDefault, case, required...
I think practically none of them are very useful, and with some of them you 
might even be able to screw something up if you change at runtime.","2006-09-13","124"
"2620","1162","1","Alex Bodnaru (alexbodn) asked for help to activate the 
inventory demo: the data is ok in the gnue database but 
there is a query that complains there is no 
oid. Reinhard Müller (reinhard) was not 
sure the inventory demo is functional any more at all - I haven't tried it 
in literally years. James Thompson (jamest) explained that 
if a table doesn't define a primary key then 
our system falls back to using oid to uniquely identify rows 
(for example, in updates). However, the postgresql database software 
(which was the most common database software people tended to use with 
GNUe) had recently dropped the oid column by 
default in new tables. In any case, the preferred way of dealing 
with this was to tell the datasource (GNUe's connection to the database) 
what column - or group of columns - represented the primary key in the 
underlying table. GNUe would then use this to identify unique rows, rather 
than the object id. This would work regardless of whether the database 
software GNUe was being used with had object ids or not. Really, object 
ids were only needed when a table is defined 
without a PK - which is really a bad practice that i'm very guilty 
of. Reinhard confirmed that the GNUe datasource would use the
primary keys on the table, but only if the datasource definition told 
it what the primary keys were. Alex confirmed this - 
it stopped complaining only after i have added 
the primarykey option.","2006-09-14","124"
"2621","1162","2","Later, James noted we have a bigger 
issue than i thought - as I just created the zipcode table with a 
PK - and the datasource still attempts to use the oid column in the 
query. Reinhard said that the reason for this was 
because the primary key field can change 
on inserts if there is a trigger on db side - so the only really 
reliable record identifier is the oid. James replied that 
the oid isn't in newest postgresql. 
Alex said that it could still be switched on - 
you may create the table with oids option. 
Reinhard asked are oid's depreciated to use 
or are they just turned off by default but still a valid option? 
James grabbed the latest tarball and read the 
release notes, reporting that reading 
the release notes it looks like OIDs are going to be around for a while - 
just not created by default.","2006-09-14","124"
"2622","1163","1","Reinhard Müller (reinhard) asked what 
is the easiest way to enforce uniqueness of a database column? 
(other than creating an unique index which will result in db exceptions 
to be thrown at the user) He did 
a PRE-FOCUSOUT trigger in which a query a second datasource pointing 
to the same table to find out whether the value already exists - 
but that doesn't seem too elegant and did not catch duplicates 
if you make both entries at the same 
commit. James Thompson (jamest) said my 
users get the dupe entry sql error. Reinhard replied 
ok, so you simply pass the SQL backend 
error to the user - same for enforcing referential integrity? (e.g. 
making sure no master is deleted as long as details exist). 
James said he had actually gone even further in using back-end 
(database) validation - something i've 
done in postgresql is setup on update triggers  on my invoice table
that block updates after the invoice has been faxed to customer. 
i'm thinking that the error message generated by that trigger is 
displayed nicely by forms - well, wx24, i've not looked at 2.6 
yet. Reinhard said that wx 2.6 was slightly different - 
you get the exception text - 
with clicking ""details"" you get the SQL statement that 
caused the error (in case of an SQL error).","2006-09-18","124"
"2623","1163","2","However, Reinhard was not that keen on passing 
backend error messages to the user - as 
they look too techy - and they are (what is a problem for me) in 
English generally. James wondered if 
we need a per form mapping of some sort - so you can define ""If you 
get this error.  Display this instead"" Reinhard had 
thought about this, but that would mean 
to parse backend error messages - depending on what backend you use 
and probably even on the backend version - maybe also on the current 
locale the backend runs on. This 
would take away the possibility to 
migrate to a different backend easily.","2006-09-18","124"
"2624","1164","1","It was asked if the GNUe project was still active - the last entry on 
the Free Software Foundation's 
website for the project was in 2002. 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) explained that the current website was 
at www.gnuenterprise.org.  
He asked if it would be possible to get the FSF website to redirect to 
the current one. James Thompson (jamest) said he would see what he could 
do.","2006-09-21","125"
"2625","1165","1","Further to 
, 
Reinhard Müller (reinhard) explained that he had not been talking 
about Application Server objects - just objects (fields, blocks, 
etc) within a Form. The point is that 
it is (was) possible to change all kinds of properties of, say, a block 
object - but it is not possible to create a new block object - so it 
will never be possible to create new forms at runtime - but only to 
change behaviour of existing forms in limited manner. 
Jason Cater (jcater) commented that come to 
think of it, if someone really needed to create a form completely at 
runtime, they could create their own .py file that imports the GNUe 
Forms Objects, and create a form that way, then activate it :)
- and a startup trigger could just import that .py file - but I can't 
imagine real-world situations where that'd really be necessary. 
Reinhard said seriously, I already 
considered something like a gnue-forms --auto <connectionname> 
<tablename> - to get some kind of ""raw database editor"" 
- it could use db introspection to get the schema of the table, and 
then create a form on the fly containing all fields.","2006-09-21","125"
